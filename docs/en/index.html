<p>In his first interview from the State Department mezzanine on August 7, 2025, U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio discussed balancing his multiple roles, including acting Secretary of USAID and National Security Advisor. Rubio emphasized the integration of these positions to streamline U.S. foreign policy coordination. He highlighted recent diplomatic efforts, including the planned meeting between President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin, noting that progress toward peace in Ukraine requires bridging gaps between the conflicting parties.</p>
<p>Rubio addressed the U.S. approach to the Israeli-Gaza conflict, underscoring the complexity involving humanitarian concerns, hostages held by Hamas, and the ongoing threat posed by the militant group. He expressed opposition to unilateral recognition of a Palestinian state without peace and condemned Hamas’s actions. On immigration, Rubio explained new visa bond requirements aimed at reducing overstays and discussed efforts to streamline visa issuance for religious workers. He also described the designation of Latin American drug cartels as terrorist organizations, enabling stronger U.S. actions against them.</p>
<p>Rubio reflected on the evolving media landscape and the Catholic Church’s role in global diplomacy, mentioning his interactions with the new Pope Leo and emphasizing the church’s potential to contribute to peace efforts worldwide.</p>

<p>A Russian documentary revealed that the Alabuga factory in Tatarstan, Russia, has integrated nearly all production stages of the Iranian-designed Shahed-136 attack drone domestically, significantly scaling manufacturing capacity. Satellite imagery confirms ongoing expansion, with new facilities and dormitories indicating potential for exponential output growth. Analysts suggest Russia may export updated drone versions, possibly back to Iran.</p>
<p>However, Western intelligence sources report growing tensions between Moscow and Tehran, citing Iran’s dissatisfaction with limited returns and delayed payments amid international sanctions. Russia’s efforts to localize production have marginalized Iran’s control over the drones. Despite this, Iran is expected to continue receiving military support from Russia, including components of S-400 air defense systems.</p>
<p>The Shahed-136 drones have been central to Russia’s drone warfare in Ukraine, with production costs declining from $200,000 in 2022 to $70,000 in 2025 per unit.</p>

<p>During a state visit to India, Philippine President Ferdinand “Bongbong” Marcos Jr. declared that the Philippines “cannot stay out” of any conflict over Taiwan due to geographic proximity and the presence of a large Filipino community in Taiwan. He emphasized the humanitarian implications and affirmed the country’s “ironclad” alliance with the United States, while asserting Manila’s readiness to defend its sovereignty and cooperate with partners facing the “Chinese threat.”</p>
<p>China swiftly condemned Marcos’s remarks, reiterating the One-China Policy and warning against foreign interference in what it considers an internal matter. Beijing accused the Philippines of “playing with fire” and urged adherence to the 1975 Joint Communique. Taiwan welcomed the statement, viewing it as recognition of regional security stakes.</p>
<p>The Philippines later reaffirmed its commitment to peace, regional stability, and the One-China Policy, emphasizing that the remarks reflected concern for Filipino nationals and geographic realities.</p>
