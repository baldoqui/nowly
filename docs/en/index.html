<div class="h2-section-wrapper"><h2>U.S. Special Forces at Fort Bragg Linked to Drug Trafficking and Murders</h2><div class="source-indicator-container"><div class="source-item" data-href="https://www.alternet.org/fort-bragg/"><img class="source-favicon" src="https://www.google.com/s2/favicons?domain=www.alternet.org" alt="Favicon for www.alternet.org"></div></div></div>
<p>A new investigative report reveals that Fort Bragg, the largest U.S. military base and home to elite units such as Delta Force and the 82nd Airborne Division, is embroiled in narcotics trafficking and associated violence. Author Seth Harp, in his book <em>The Fort Bragg Cartel: Drug Trafficking and Murder in the Special Forces</em>, details at least 14 cases over the past five years involving soldiers trained at Fort Bragg who were arrested, killed, or implicated in drug trafficking, often linked to Mexican cartels like Los Zetas.</p>
<p>The book highlights the discovery of two murdered soldiers in December 2020 on a Fort Bragg training range, suspected victims of a drug deal gone wrong. Harp describes how Los Zetas, a cartel originally trained by U.S. Special Forces as an elite Mexican paratrooper unit, later turned rogue and became heavily involved in drug trafficking. The report also notes over 100 soldier deaths at Fort Bragg from 2020 to 2021, mostly stateside, with many linked to suicide and drug-related causes. Despite the severity, no significant investigations or reforms have been initiated.</p>
<p>Harp critiques the broader U.S. military and government complicity in narcotics, pointing to Afghanistan’s status as the largest heroin producer during the U.S. occupation, with drug trafficking facilitated by warlords and officials allied with U.S. forces. The book also exposes covert U.S. Special Forces operations in countries like Ukraine and Mexico, often without public or congressional oversight. The report raises concerns about recent Pentagon directives authorizing military action against drug cartels abroad, questioning the legality and effectiveness of such measures.</p>

<div class="h2-section-wrapper"><h2>Kaiser Permanente to Pause Gender-Affirming Surgeries for Under-19 Patients</h2><div class="source-indicator-container"><div class="source-item" data-href="https://www.dailybulletin.com/2025/08/16/kaiser-permanente-retreat-on-gender-affirming-care-called-denial-of-basic-humanity/"><img class="source-favicon" src="https://www.google.com/s2/favicons?domain=www.dailybulletin.com" alt="Favicon for www.dailybulletin.com"></div></div></div>
<p>Kaiser Permanente announced it will halt gender-affirming surgeries for patients under the age of 19 starting August 29, citing threats of federal funding cuts amid ongoing political and legal pressures. The decision follows similar service reductions by Stanford Medicine and Children’s Hospital Los Angeles. Kaiser officials emphasized that non-surgical gender-affirming care, such as hormone therapy and counseling, will continue.</p>
<p>The pause responds to executive orders and federal actions initiated under the Trump administration, which labeled gender-affirming care for minors as harmful and sought to restrict it nationwide. California law prohibits denying services based on gender identity, but the threat of losing federal funds has prompted providers to curtail services. Advocacy groups warn that such restrictions increase risks of anxiety, depression, and suicide among transgender youth.</p>
<p>Protests have occurred outside Kaiser’s Los Angeles Medical Center, with supporters demanding continued access to care, while some opponents celebrate the decision. Kaiser remains recognized for LGBTQ+ healthcare but faces challenges balancing legal compliance and patient needs amid a politically charged environment.</p>

<p>The Midcontinent Independent System Operator (MISO), responsible for managing the electric grid across much of the U.S. Midwest, is confronting a critical shortage of electric power generation. In response, the U.S. Secretary of Energy has ordered additional generation capacity to address the emergency.</p>
<p>MISO’s situation raises concerns about grid reliability and energy security in the region amid rising demand and potential supply constraints. The agency has communicated these challenges in a public comment letter to the U.S. Department of Energy, seeking support and coordination to mitigate the shortage.</p>
<p>This development highlights ongoing pressures on the U.S. energy infrastructure and the need for strategic planning to ensure continuous power availability.</p>
