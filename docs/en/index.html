<p>Veteran journalist Anne Applebaum’s recent reporting from Sudan reveals the devastating human toll of the ongoing civil war between the Sudanese army and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF). The conflict, ignited in 2023, is driven by power struggles over territory, gold mines, and control of trade routes, rather than ideological differences. Both sides have perpetrated ethnic cleansing, theft, and widespread violence including sexual assault against civilians.</p>
<p>Applebaum highlights the collapse of international aid and diplomatic engagement that once sought to stabilize Sudan. The dismantling of the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), reductions in foreign aid, and waning influence of the United Nations have left Sudan isolated amid rising violence. Aid organizations dependent on USAID face logistical failures, contributing to food shortages and deteriorating medical care. For instance, a children’s hospital struggles to distribute critical nutritional supplements amid supply disruptions.</p>
<p>The war has displaced an estimated 14 million people—more than the combined displaced populations of Ukraine and Gaza—with widespread malnutrition, disease, and destruction. Regional powers including the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Turkey, Egypt, and Iran have inserted themselves into the conflict, supplying weapons and backing different factions, exacerbating the violence. Applebaum underscores a nihilistic environment where lawlessness prevails, and greed and transactionalism dominate.</p>
<p>The report also reflects on the erosion of the liberal world order, noting that the U.S. withdrawal from international institutions and diminished diplomatic influence have emboldened autocratic actors. Applebaum warns that the forces undermining Sudan are spreading to other countries, and that old norms are being replaced by voids of governance and stability.</p>

<p>Russian President Vladimir Putin held talks with U.S. President Donald Trump’s special envoy Steve Witkoff in Moscow on August 6, amid a looming White House deadline for Russia to reach a peace deal with Ukraine. The Kremlin described the meeting as “useful and constructive,” lasting approximately three hours. Trump characterized the talks as “highly productive” and indicated a “good chance” of a summit with Putin “very soon.”</p>
<p>The meeting follows months of stalled negotiations and increased hostilities in the three-year conflict following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in 2022. Trump has set a Friday deadline for Russia to agree to a ceasefire or face severe economic sanctions, including tariffs on Russian oil buyers such as China and India. The White House press secretary confirmed that Trump is open to meeting both Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, though no date or location has been announced.</p>
<p>U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio tempered expectations, noting many impediments remain before a productive meeting can occur. Meanwhile, Russia has dismissed threats of sanctions as “illegitimate,” and Putin’s spokesman emphasized patience in restoring bilateral relations.</p>
<p>The conflict continues with Russia intensifying missile and drone attacks on Ukrainian infrastructure, while Ukraine expresses readiness to defend its sovereignty. Sanctions remain a key tool under consideration by the U.S. to pressure Moscow to end the war.</p>

<p>The political standoff in Texas escalated as Republican Governor Greg Abbott filed an emergency petition with the Texas Supreme Court seeking to remove state Representative Gene Wu, chairman of the Texas House Democratic Caucus. Abbott claims Wu and other Democrats have “forfeited” their offices by fleeing the state to deny the quorum necessary to pass a GOP-backed congressional redistricting map, which could shift five U.S. House seats to Republicans.</p>
<p>Wu condemned the move as an attempt to “silence my dissent” against what he calls a “racist gerrymandered map.” Texas Republicans have twice failed to convene the legislature due to the Democrats’ absence. The dispute has national implications, as Democrats need to net only three seats nationally to regain control of the House.</p>
<p>Texas Democrats have been speaking out across the country, including holding a news conference in Massachusetts. Illinois Governor JB Pritzker reported threats against the lawmakers sheltering in Illinois and assured their safety with law enforcement support.</p>
<p>Attorney General Ken Paxton and Abbott are pursuing legal actions including civil arrest warrants and investigations into alleged bribery to support the Democrats’ efforts. U.S. Senator John Cornyn requested FBI assistance in returning the lawmakers. President Trump echoed calls for the Democrats to return and face the legislative process.</p>

<div class="h2-section-wrapper"><h2>Riot Platforms Reports Q2 2025 Earnings; Expands Data Center Development</h2><div class="source-indicator-container"><div class="source-item" data-href="https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2025/08/06/riot-riot-q2-2025-earnings-call-transcript/?source=iedfolrf0000001"><img class="source-favicon" src="https://www.google.com/s2/favicons?domain=www.fool.com" alt="Favicon for www.fool.com"></div></div></div>
<p>Riot Platforms, a leading Bitcoin mining and data center company, reported its Q2 2025 financial results, highlighting a net income of $219.5 million driven by a $470.8 million mark-to-market gain from Bitcoin price appreciation. The company produced 1,406 Bitcoin during the quarter, with a 5% sequential growth in self-mining hash rate to 35.4 exahash, though global hash rate rose 9%.</p>
<p>Riot is advancing its strategic shift from Bitcoin mining to data center development, controlling 858 acres at its Corsicana site to build high-performance computing facilities. The company hired Jonathan Gibbs as Chief Data Center Officer to lead build-out and tenant leasing efforts. Riot also placed purchase orders for 10 exahash of new miners, funded by cash reserves.</p>
<p>The company raised its Q4 2025 hash rate forecast to 40 exahash and provided a Q1 2026 forecast of 45 exahash, aiming to maintain approximately 4% of the global Bitcoin network. Riot emphasized its strategy of “monetizing megawatts” by maximizing power portfolio value through data centers and mining operations.</p>

<div class="h2-section-wrapper"><h2>Israeli Pager Bombings Target Hezbollah, Causing Mass Casualties and Long-Term Impact</h2><div class="source-indicator-container"><div class="source-item" data-href="https://bostonherald.com/2025/08/06/lebanon-pager-attack-survivors/"><img class="source-favicon" src="https://www.google.com/s2/favicons?domain=bostonherald.com" alt="Favicon for bostonherald.com"></div><div class="source-item" data-href="https://www.times-standard.com/2025/08/06/lebanon-pager-attack-survivors/"><img class="source-favicon" src="https://www.google.com/s2/favicons?domain=www.times-standard.com" alt="Favicon for www.times-standard.com"></div></div></div>
<p>On September 17, 2024, Israel remotely detonated thousands of pagers distributed to Hezbollah members across Lebanon, in a covert operation aimed at disrupting the group’s communications and weakening its military capabilities. The attack wounded more than 3,000 people and killed 12, including two children.</p>
<p>The pagers exploded upon being picked up or activated, causing severe injuries such as blindness, loss of fingers, and facial scars to Hezbollah fighters and their families. Survivors describe hospitals overwhelmed by casualties and a community grappling with long-term physical and psychological trauma.</p>
<p>Human rights organizations have criticized the attack as indiscriminate, given the widespread harm to civilians and the near impossibility of distinguishing pager holders. Hezbollah acknowledged negligence in procuring the rigged devices but denied collaboration with Israel.</p>
<p>The attack marked a turning point in Israel's campaign against Hezbollah, which subsequently suffered significant military and financial setbacks. Survivors continue to recover, supported by Hezbollah’s social services, while the group faces the burden of treating thousands of injured members.</p>
