<div class="h2-section-wrapper"><h2>Trump Plans National Guard Deployment and Homeless Evictions in Washington, D.C.</h2><div class="source-indicator-container"><div class="source-item" data-href="https://sofrep.com/news/sofrep-daily-2025-aug-11-am/"><img class="source-favicon" src="https://www.google.com/s2/favicons?domain=sofrep.com" alt="Favicon for sofrep.com"></div><div class="source-item" data-href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/policy/defense/3495986/ukraine-zelensky-feels-cold-draft-of-isolation/"><img class="source-favicon" src="https://www.google.com/s2/favicons?domain=www.washingtonexaminer.com" alt="Favicon for www.washingtonexaminer.com"></div></div></div>
<p>U.S. President Donald Trump announced intentions to deploy hundreds of National Guard troops to Washington, D.C., aiming to address crime and remove homeless individuals from the city. Trump declared on his social media platform that homeless people would be relocated “FAR from the Capital” with shelter provided, while criminals would be jailed. The administration is preparing for the deployment, although final decisions on troop numbers and roles have not been made.</p>
<p>This move follows a violent attack on a young administration staffer, prompting the deployment of 450 federal law enforcement officers citywide over the recent weekend. Despite these developments, D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser highlighted that violent crime has decreased by 26% and overall crime by 7% compared to 2024, marking a 30-year low. The legal basis for mass evictions remains unclear, given federal authority in D.C. covers only federal land and buildings. Trump is expected to hold a press conference addressing crime in the capital.</p>

<div class="h2-section-wrapper"><h2>Israeli Airstrike Kills Al Jazeera Journalist Anas Al Sharif and Colleagues in Gaza</h2><div class="source-indicator-container"><div class="source-item" data-href="https://dawn.com/news/1930169/award-winning-al-jazeera-journalist-anas-al-sharif-4-colleagues-killed-in-targeted-israeli-airstrike"><img class="source-favicon" src="https://www.google.com/s2/favicons?domain=dawn.com" alt="Favicon for dawn.com"></div><div class="source-item" data-href="https://sofrep.com/news/sofrep-daily-2025-aug-11-am/"><img class="source-favicon" src="https://www.google.com/s2/favicons?domain=sofrep.com" alt="Favicon for sofrep.com"></div></div></div>
<p>An Israeli airstrike on a tent opposite Shifa Hospital in Gaza City killed prominent Al Jazeera journalist Anas Al Sharif, aged 28, along with four colleagues, including three other journalists and a driver. The strike occurred amid an expanded Israeli military campaign targeting Gaza City and surrounding areas. Al Sharif had previously been threatened by Israel and was accused by the Israeli military of ties to Hamas, allegations denied by Al Jazeera and the journalist himself.</p>
<p>The United Nations human rights office condemned the killings as a “grave breach of international humanitarian law,” while media organizations and rights groups labeled the attack a deliberate targeting of journalists. The Gaza Health Ministry reported that 237 journalists have been killed since the onset of the conflict in October 2023. The incident has intensified international scrutiny amid ongoing hostilities and humanitarian crises in Gaza.</p>

<p>London’s Metropolitan Police arrested 532 people during a pro-Palestinian protest in Westminster supporting Palestine Action, a group recently designated as a terrorist organization under UK law. The majority of those detained, including many aged over 60, were arrested for displaying placards supporting the banned group. The protest was staged to challenge the government’s enforcement of the proscription.</p>
<p>Home Secretary Yvette Cooper defended the ban, citing Palestine Action’s involvement in violent attacks, injuries, and significant property damage, including incidents at a Royal Air Force base. Supporters argue the ban infringes on freedom of expression and are legally contesting the designation. Police are reviewing cases with prosecutorial and attorney general approval expected before charges are filed.</p>

<div class="h2-section-wrapper"><h2>Trump-Putin Summit in Alaska Raises Concerns Over Ukraine Peace Negotiations</h2><div class="source-indicator-container"><div class="source-item" data-href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/policy/defense/3495986/ukraine-zelensky-feels-cold-draft-of-isolation/"><img class="source-favicon" src="https://www.google.com/s2/favicons?domain=www.washingtonexaminer.com" alt="Favicon for www.washingtonexaminer.com"></div><div class="source-item" data-href="https://sofrep.com/news/sofrep-daily-2025-aug-11-am/"><img class="source-favicon" src="https://www.google.com/s2/favicons?domain=sofrep.com" alt="Favicon for sofrep.com"></div></div></div>
<p>U.S. President Donald Trump is scheduled to meet Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska on August 15 to discuss ending the war in Ukraine. Trump indicated that the talks might involve “some swapping of territories,” a proposal strongly rejected by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, who reaffirmed Ukraine’s constitutional commitment to its territorial integrity.</p>
<p>European leaders, including those from the EU, Britain, Germany, France, Poland, and Finland, issued a joint statement emphasizing that any peace deal must include Ukraine and uphold its sovereignty. They stressed that negotiations require a ceasefire and robust security guarantees. U.S. officials have suggested a possible trilateral meeting involving Zelensky, but the Kremlin maintains that such talks should occur only when an agreement is near.</p>

<div class="h2-section-wrapper"><h2>Kuwait Revokes Citizenship of Nearly 50,000 People in Crackdown on Illegal Nationality Claims</h2><div class="source-indicator-container"><div class="source-item" data-href="https://www.thenationalnews.com/news/mena/2025/08/11/everyone-under-review-as-kuwait-revokes-citizenship-of-nearly-50000-people/"><img class="source-favicon" src="https://www.google.com/s2/favicons?domain=www.thenationalnews.com" alt="Favicon for www.thenationalnews.com"></div></div></div>
<p>Kuwait has revoked the citizenship of approximately 50,000 individuals as part of a campaign targeting illegal nationality claims. Sheikh Fahad Yousef Saud Al Sabah, Kuwait’s First Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Interior, announced that all nationality files are under detailed scrutiny without exception. The crackdown aims to identify forgers and ensure that citizenship is granted only to those with legal claims.</p>
<p>The Supreme Committee for Kuwaiti Nationality oversees the review, and in some cases, names of those stripped of citizenship have been made public. Kuwait does not permit dual nationality, requiring individuals to renounce previous citizenship upon naturalization. The campaign has sparked debate amid the presence of about 120,000 stateless people (“bidoon”) in the country.</p>
