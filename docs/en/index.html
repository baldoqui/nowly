<p>Israel’s political-security cabinet approved a plan early on Friday to take control of Gaza City, marking a significant escalation in the nearly two-year-old conflict with Hamas. The plan involves the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) preparing to take control of Gaza City while continuing to provide humanitarian aid to civilians outside combat zones. Gaza City, located in the northern part of the Gaza Strip, is the largest city in the enclave and home to nearly half of the territory’s population.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu stated that Israel intends to take military control of the entire Gaza Strip but emphasized that Israel does not want to govern the territory permanently. Instead, he suggested that control would be handed over to Arab forces, although details on which countries or entities would govern remain unclear. The plan includes evacuating Palestinian civilians from Gaza City before launching a ground offensive. Israeli military officials reportedly expressed concerns about the risks of expanding operations, including potential dangers to Israeli hostages held by Hamas.</p>
<p>The decision has drawn widespread condemnation internationally. The United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights called for an immediate halt to the plan, citing violations of international law and the exacerbation of the humanitarian crisis. Countries including Turkey, China, Australia, and the United Kingdom have voiced concerns, warning that the takeover would deepen the conflict and cause further suffering. Protests have erupted within Israel, with many citizens and families of hostages opposing the military expansion, fearing it will endanger captives and civilians alike.</p>
<p>The Gaza Strip remains under severe strain, with Israeli forces controlling approximately 75% of the territory. The population, estimated at around two million, has faced repeated displacement and is on the brink of famine. Humanitarian groups report worsening conditions, including acute malnutrition among children. Hamas and other Palestinian factions have vowed to resist the takeover and have demanded negotiations for any release of hostages.</p>

<p>Ensign Energy Services Inc., an international oilfield services contractor, released its financial results for the second quarter ended June 30, 2025. The company reported revenue of CAD 372.4 million, a 5% decrease compared to CAD 391.8 million in the same quarter of 2024. For the first half of 2025, revenue totaled CAD 808.9 million, down 2% from CAD 823.1 million in 2024.</p>
<p>Adjusted EBITDA declined by 19% to CAD 81.4 million in Q2 2025 from CAD 100.2 million in Q2 2024. Net loss attributable to common shareholders increased significantly to CAD 26.4 million (CAD 0.14 per share) from CAD 4.5 million (CAD 0.02 per share) in the prior year quarter. Funds flow from operations decreased 26% to CAD 72.5 million.</p>
<p>The company’s Canadian operations showed revenue growth of 8% in Q2, driven by increased operating days and rates, supported by the completion of the Trans Mountain Pipeline expansion. In contrast, United States operations saw a 5% revenue decline due to subdued activity amid geopolitical tensions, commodity price volatility, and customer capital discipline. International operations experienced a 17% revenue decrease, attributed to rigs coming off contract and operational suspensions in Venezuela following U.S. sanctions.</p>
<p>Ensign Energy continues to focus on disciplined capital allocation and debt reduction, having repaid CAD 42.9 million in debt during the first half of 2025, with a target to reduce total debt by CAD 600 million by the end of 2025. The company remains compliant with its credit facility covenants.</p>
<p>Capital expenditures in Q2 2025 were CAD 49.2 million, including CAD 13.3 million in upgrade capital and CAD 37.4 million in maintenance capital. The increase in upgrade capital is related to new contracts in Oman and rig relocations.</p>

<p>A group of approximately 200 U.S. citizens, including victims and family members of attacks by Hamas and Hezbollah, filed a lawsuit in Washington, D.C., against the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) and its U.S.-based nonprofit, UNRWA USA. The plaintiffs accuse the agency of violating U.S. antiterrorism laws by allegedly providing funds and support to Hamas and Hezbollah, classified as foreign terrorist organizations, and employing staff involved in terror activities.</p>
<p>UNRWA condemned the lawsuit as baseless and morally reprehensible, emphasizing its humanitarian mission and role in supporting Palestinian refugees. The agency has faced scrutiny following allegations of infiltration by terrorist members and has terminated several employees suspected of involvement in attacks.</p>
<p>The Biden administration supports UNRWA’s immunity from civil litigation as a U.N. subsidiary, but the Trump administration reversed this stance in 2025, arguing the agency should not be immune. The lawsuit seeks compensatory and punitive damages.</p>
<p>Funding for UNRWA remains frozen since January 2024 amid ongoing investigations and political disputes. UNRWA continues to provide essential services to millions of Palestinian refugees across multiple regions.</p>

<div class="h2-section-wrapper"><h2>Westerville, Ohio Reflects on 150 Years Since Whiskey Wars and Evolution from Dry Town to Brewing Hub</h2><div class="source-indicator-container"><div class="source-item" data-href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/westerville-brewery-distillery-nod-city-085504234.html"><img class="source-favicon" src="https://www.google.com/s2/favicons?domain=www.yahoo.com" alt="Favicon for www.yahoo.com"></div></div></div>
<p>Westerville, Ohio, commemorates the 150th anniversary of the Westerville Whiskey Wars, a turbulent period from 1875 to 1879 marked by violent opposition to saloons in the town. The community resisted the establishment of saloons, fearing social problems and crime, resulting in protests and the destruction of alcohol-serving establishments.</p>
<p>Westerville played a central role in the temperance movement as the headquarters of the Anti-Saloon League, which influenced national prohibition policies and earned the town the nickname "The Dry Capital of the World." The League’s publication, The American Issue, had a circulation of over 18 million during its peak in 1920.</p>
<p>Though prohibition was repealed in 1933, Westerville remained dry until 2006, when voters approved liquor licenses in the Uptown District, sparking revitalization. The city now hosts several breweries, including Temperance Row Brewing Company and High Bank Distillery, which pay homage to the town’s prohibition history through their products and branding.</p>
<p>Westerville’s transformation from a dry town to a vibrant dining and entertainment destination highlights shifting social attitudes and economic development tied to alcohol sales.</p>

<p>The United Arab Emirates is progressing with plans for a 350 km/h electric high-speed rail line connecting Abu Dhabi and Dubai, aiming to revolutionize public transport and economic integration between the two major cities. The project, announced in January 2025, will feature six stations in its first phase, including key locations such as Abu Dhabi’s islands, city airports, and Dubai Creek.</p>
<p>Experts highlight the UAE’s favorable geography, stable climate, and wide motorway corridors as ideal conditions for successful high-speed rail development, contrasting with challenges faced by similar projects in other countries. The line is expected to cut travel time between Abu Dhabi and Dubai to approximately 30 minutes, enhancing business, tourism, and residential mobility.</p>
<p>The high-speed rail is part of the UAE’s broader vision to modernize infrastructure, reduce traffic congestion, and lower carbon emissions. It is anticipated to foster corporate confidence and stimulate new development, potentially creating “high-speed rail suburbs” similar to those seen in Japan.</p>
<p>The UAE joins other Gulf countries like Saudi Arabia, which operates the Haramain High-Speed Railway, in expanding rail connectivity as a sustainable transport solution.</p>

<p>Swiss entrepreneur Eser Karatas founded Swiss African Premium Beverage (SAPB) in Cameroon, tapping into Africa’s rapidly expanding beer market. The brewery produces Rox, a premium pilsner lager recognized as the third-best on the continent at the African Beer Cup, competing against 260 beers from 14 countries.</p>
<p>Karatas faced numerous challenges, including unreliable power supply and infrastructure issues, which he addressed by installing a 360 kW solar power system to operate the brewery independently, marking the largest autonomous solar installation in Cameroon. This initiative aims to reduce emissions and operational costs.</p>
<p>The brewery currently produces approximately 20,000 liters monthly, primarily serving hotels, bars, restaurants, and gas stations in the Douala region. Karatas plans to expand production capacity and distribution while maintaining a focus on quality over quantity.</p>
<p>Africa represents the world’s fastest-growing beer market, with Cameroon experiencing supply shortages during peak periods. SAPB’s establishment reflects entrepreneurial innovation and sustainable development in emerging African markets.</p>
