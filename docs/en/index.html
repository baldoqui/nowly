<p>In the Seminole Nation of Oklahoma, voters have elected new leadership, marking the third time in eight years that an incumbent chief has been unseated. Sena Yesslith narrowly defeated incumbent Chief Lewis Johnson in a runoff election held on August 9, receiving 545 votes (51.2 percent) to Johnson’s 520 (48.8 percent). Sheila Little-Harjo also won the assistant chief position over incumbent Brian Thomas Palmer.</p>
<p>The election saw a turnout of approximately 1,065 voters, similar to the July 12 primary. Yesslith’s victory makes her the second female chief in the nation’s history. Both Yesslith and Little-Harjo have extensive experience in tribal governance and community services. Johnson and Palmer expressed gratitude for their time in office and wished the incoming leaders success. The new chief and assistant chief are scheduled to be sworn in on September 6 at the Mekusukey Mission.</p>
<p>Other tribal elections concluded recently include Jennifer Turner winning the Choctaw Nation District 5 runoff, and Uriah Grass securing the Cherokee Nation District 4 seat. The Muscogee Nation saw three candidates file for the Mvskoke District “B” seat, with the general election set for September 20.</p>

<p>Russian forces have achieved their most significant territorial gains on the Ukrainian frontlines since 2024, focusing on disrupting Ukrainian logistics in Donetsk province. Over the past month, Russian troops reportedly captured between 550 and 700 square kilometers, pressing toward key cities such as Dobropillya, Kostyantynivka, and Pokrovsk.</p>
<p>The Russian military’s strategy involves severing supply routes and employing advanced unmanned aerial vehicles (drones) to extend their attack range up to 25 kilometers behind Ukrainian lines. This aerial dominance has complicated Ukrainian troop rotations and logistics. Civilians in affected areas are evacuating en masse, with organizations like Proliska facilitating daily relocations.</p>
<p>Ukrainian forces continue to defend critical locations, including Pokrovsk and Kostyantynivka, despite ongoing assaults and infiltration attempts. The conflict remains fluid, with Russian advances threatening to reshape control in eastern Ukraine by the end of 2025.</p>

<p>Two blind women, Camille Tate and Sherri Brun, were left as the only passengers on a Southwest Airlines flight from New Orleans to Orlando after a rebooking miscommunication. Their original flight was delayed by five hours, and while other passengers were rebooked on an earlier flight, Tate and Brun were not informed due to their inability to see rebooking notices and a lack of verbal communication from the airline.</p>
<p>The women waited at their original gate throughout the delay and only discovered they were the sole passengers upon boarding. Southwest Airlines apologized for the oversight and offered each woman a $100 voucher but stated a full refund was not possible since the women completed their originally scheduled flight.</p>
<p>Tate and Brun have called for improved communication methods for passengers with disabilities to prevent similar incidents in the future. Southwest Airlines reiterated its commitment to enhancing travel experiences for all customers, especially those requiring additional assistance.</p>

<div class="h2-section-wrapper"><h2>Baku Military Court Continues Trial of Armenian Citizens on War Crimes and Terrorism Charges</h2><div class="source-indicator-container"><div class="source-item" data-href="https://trend.az/azerbaijan/politics/4079536.html"><img class="source-favicon" src="https://www.google.com/s2/favicons?domain=trend.az" alt="Favicon for trend.az"></div></div></div>
<p>The Baku Military Court in Azerbaijan is conducting open hearings against fifteen Armenian citizens, including prominent figures such as Arayik Harutyunyan and Arkadi Ghukasyan. The defendants face multiple charges related to crimes against peace and humanity, war crimes, genocide, terrorism, and forcible seizure of power, stemming from Armenia’s military aggression against Azerbaijan.</p>
<p>The trial, presided over by Judge Zeynal Aghayev, includes testimonies from victims and legal heirs detailing atrocities such as torture, killings during the 44-day Patriotic War in 2020, the Khojaly massacre, and captivity conditions. Several victims recounted severe abuse, including beatings, electric shocks, and executions.</p>
<p>The prosecution alleges that these crimes were orchestrated under the leadership of Armenian state officials and military commanders. The trial is ongoing, with the next session scheduled for August 14.</p>

<div class="h2-section-wrapper"><h2>Human Rights Watch Highlights Domestic Violence and Education Challenges in Kyrgyzstan</h2><div class="source-indicator-container"><div class="source-item" data-href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2022/12/12/kyrgyzstan-submission-un-committee-rights-child"><img class="source-favicon" src="https://www.google.com/s2/favicons?domain=www.hrw.org" alt="Favicon for www.hrw.org"></div></div></div>
<p>Human Rights Watch has submitted a report to the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child outlining concerns over Kyrgyzstan’s handling of domestic violence, forced marriage, and education access. Despite legal reforms criminalizing domestic violence and bride kidnapping, these issues remain pervasive, with inadequate shelter spaces and insufficient law enforcement response.</p>
<p>The COVID-19 pandemic exacerbated risks, with a significant rise in domestic violence cases during lockdowns and closures of support services. Police response is often inadequate, and protection orders are inconsistently enforced.</p>
<p>Education challenges include digital divide issues during pandemic-related school closures, with children from rural and low-income families disproportionately affected. Attacks on schools during border conflicts with Tajikistan have further disrupted education. Children with disabilities face barriers due to segregation and lack of inclusive education.</p>
<p>Human Rights Watch urges the Kyrgyz government to improve legal enforcement, increase support services, ensure inclusive education, and endorse international commitments such as the Safe Schools Declaration.</p>
