<p>Donald Trump has stated he will only meet Russian President Vladimir Putin if Putin agrees to three-way peace talks involving Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky. The Kremlin confirmed that a meeting between Putin and Trump could occur as early as next week, suggesting the United Arab Emirates as a potential venue. However, Putin indicated he is not yet ready to meet Zelensky, citing the need for certain conditions to be met first.</p>
<p>White House officials emphasized that Putin must agree to meet Zelensky for the Trump-Putin talks to proceed. British former Defence Secretary Ben Wallace urged that Britain be included in the talks to prevent Zelensky from being pressured by Trump and Putin. Meanwhile, details of a proposed American peace plan have emerged, suggesting a truce rather than a formal peace settlement. This plan would allow Russia to maintain de facto control over occupied territories without Ukraine officially ceding them, while preserving Ukraine's path to NATO membership and Western military support.</p>
<p>Zelensky expressed readiness for talks and a ceasefire, seeking a brave approach from Russia and emphasizing Europe’s role in negotiations and reconstruction. Polls indicate that only a quarter of Ukrainians want to fight Russia to the end, reflecting a shift in public sentiment after more than three years of conflict.</p>

<div class="h2-section-wrapper"><h2>Israel’s Mossad Executes Covert June 13 Attacks Inside Iran Targeting Nuclear Facilities</h2><div class="source-indicator-container"><div class="source-item" data-href="https://www.defenseone.com/threats/2025/08/inside-israels-june-13-attack-iran/407289/"><img class="source-favicon" src="https://www.google.com/s2/favicons?domain=www.defenseone.com" alt="Favicon for www.defenseone.com"></div></div></div>
<p>On June 13, Israeli intelligence agency Mossad led covert commando operations inside Iran targeting anti-aircraft batteries and ballistic missile launchers near Tehran. The attacks were carried out by Israeli-trained Iranian dissidents and foreign operatives, significantly aiding Israel’s air force in conducting extensive bombing runs on Iran’s nuclear sites, including the uranium-enrichment facility at Fordo.</p>
<p>These operations are part of a long-term effort by Israeli intelligence to prevent Iran from developing nuclear weapons. The Mossad recruited agents from Iran’s ethnic minorities and exiles, offering incentives such as medical care abroad and educational opportunities. The June attacks, code-named Operation Rising Lion, involved about 70 commando teams striking key military targets, allowing Israeli airstrikes to destroy roughly half of Iran’s ballistic missiles and launchers.</p>
<p>Israeli officials emphasized the shift from relying solely on Israeli operatives to employing foreign agents inside Iran, reflecting the regime’s growing unpopularity. The campaign included targeted assassinations of Iranian nuclear scientists and military commanders. The Mossad’s intelligence and covert actions have played a pivotal role in curbing Iran’s nuclear ambitions, though the overall impact on Iran’s program remains subject to analysis.</p>

<p>The United States implemented higher tariffs on imports from more than 60 countries and the European Union, with rates ranging from 10% to 20%, four months after President Donald Trump announced the measures. The tariffs include 15% on products from the EU, Japan, and South Korea, and 20% on imports from Taiwan, Vietnam, and Bangladesh. The administration expects these tariffs to stimulate investment and job creation in the U.S.</p>
<p>The tariffs have prompted concerns from global businesses and governments. Ralph Lauren warned that increased costs could squeeze profit margins, while Indian exporters said the tariffs impact over half of their shipments to the U.S., threatening long-standing trade relationships. Brazil and India’s leaders held talks to discuss the tariffs and reaffirmed plans to boost bilateral trade.</p>
<p>The tariffs are expected to raise prices for American consumers, with an estimated average import tax of 18.6%, the highest since 1933. The National Retail Federation highlighted ongoing uncertainty due to negotiations and discrepancies in tariff agreements. Several companies, including cosmetics brand e.l.f. Beauty, have raised prices citing tariff costs.</p>
<p>Switzerland faces 39% tariffs on a majority of its exports to the U.S., prompting government efforts to mitigate impacts on key industries and workers. South Korea reached a tariff deal with the U.S. reducing some rates to 15%, but trade uncertainty remains. Analysts warn that tariffs could disrupt supply chains, increase prices, and affect global trade dynamics.</p>

<p>The American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM) released the 2025 American Fitness Index ranking Oklahoma City as the least healthy among America’s 100 largest cities, repeating its position from 2024. The index evaluates personal health and community environment factors influencing active lifestyles.</p>
<p>Oklahoma City scored poorly in personal health indicators such as aerobic and strength activity, public transportation use, and vegetable consumption. Tulsa ranked 90th overall, showing some improvement. Both cities had below-average scores in health behaviors but differed in environmental factors, with Tulsa outperforming Oklahoma City in walkability, bikeability, and air quality.</p>
<p>Oklahoma City spends more per resident on parks than Tulsa but lags behind the average city. Both cities face challenges in promoting healthy behaviors and providing community assets that encourage active living. The ACSM report aims to guide local officials in improving residents’ health and quality of life.</p>

<p>The 2025 Toyota HiAce LWB Barn Door Panel Van continues the legacy of the popular commercial van with minimal changes from previous models. Powered by a 2.8-litre four-cylinder turbo-diesel engine paired with a six-speed automatic transmission, the van offers a payload capacity of 1075 kg and 6.2 cubic meters of cargo space.</p>
<p>The van’s interior is utilitarian, featuring durable materials suitable for heavy use, with practical storage options and an infotainment system that includes satellite navigation, wired Apple CarPlay, and Android Auto. The barn doors provide excellent access to the cargo area, and sliding side doors facilitate loading and unloading.</p>
<p>Safety features include a five-star ANCAP rating, autonomous emergency braking, blind-spot monitoring, lane-keep assist, and multiple airbags. The HiAce’s driving experience is comfortable and maneuverable despite its size, with a smooth engine and solid steering. While the infotainment system shows its age and the service intervals are relatively short, the HiAce remains a reliable and versatile choice for commercial transport needs.</p>

<div class="h2-section-wrapper"><h2>Rising Crime Challenges Syria’s Stabilization Efforts Amid Post-Conflict Recovery</h2><div class="source-indicator-container"><div class="source-item" data-href="https://www.thenationalnews.com/news/mena/2025/08/07/rising-crime-undermines-syrias-stabilisation/"><img class="source-favicon" src="https://www.google.com/s2/favicons?domain=www.thenationalnews.com" alt="Favicon for www.thenationalnews.com"></div></div></div>
<p>As Syria continues to recover from years of civil war and the recent deposition of former President Bashar al-Assad, rising crime has become a significant challenge undermining stabilization efforts. Incidents of highway robberies, kidnappings, and armed thefts have increased, causing residents and tourists to avoid previously safe areas such as the mountain town of Marmarita.</p>
<p>The UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported 254 non-political killings in 2025, including women and children, with the highest numbers in Deraa, Damascus, and Aleppo provinces. Notable violent incidents include the murder of actress Diala Al Wadi and doctor Amal Al Bustani in affluent Damascus districts, crimes previously unheard of in these areas.</p>
<p>Security forces acknowledge the problem and have increased personnel and surveillance measures, including installing cameras and deploying more officers. However, economic difficulties and population displacements, particularly in Aleppo, contribute to persistent lawlessness. Some fear the re-emergence of gangs with ties to the former regime, complicating efforts to establish lasting law and order.</p>

<div class="h2-section-wrapper"><h2>Russia Faces International Legal Pressure with New Tribunal Proposed for War Crimes</h2><div class="source-indicator-container"><div class="source-item" data-href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/kevinholdenplatt/2025/08/07/a-new-nuremberg-style-tribunal-awaits-putins-arrest-extradition/"><img class="source-favicon" src="https://www.google.com/s2/favicons?domain=www.forbes.com" alt="Favicon for www.forbes.com"></div></div></div>
<p>Legal scholars and international bodies are intensifying efforts to hold Russian leaders accountable for alleged war crimes in Ukraine. Russia’s threats of war against countries considering arresting President Vladimir Putin under an International Criminal Court (ICC) warrant violate the United Nations Charter, according to experts.</p>
<p>Deputy Chairman of Russia’s Security Council Dmitry Medvedev warned Germany that arresting Putin would be a declaration of war and threatened missile strikes on the ICC headquarters in The Hague. These provocations risk undermining the global order and embolden autocratic regimes.</p>
<p>In response, a coalition under the Council of Europe is establishing a Special Tribunal to prosecute top Russian officials for the crime of aggression and related war crimes. This tribunal is envisioned as a new Nuremberg-style court, focusing on Putin, his prime minister, foreign minister, and potentially allies such as Belarus and North Korea.</p>
<p>The tribunal will rely on extensive digital evidence, including satellite imagery and eyewitness testimony, to prosecute those responsible. While personal immunity protects sitting leaders, it lapses upon leaving office, raising prospects for future arrests contingent on regime changes in Russia and allied nations.</p>

<p>Fullerton’s Golden Hill Little League team delivered a commanding 11-0 victory over Northern California’s Menlo Park Alpine Little League in the West Region elimination semifinal. The win secured a rematch against Hawaii in the West Region final.</p>

<p>Golden Hill’s success reflects a strategic approach and team cohesion, with contributions from several players including Lincoln Ploog, Jacob Yun, and Jake Morris. The team had previously struggled to score in the tournament but found momentum in this decisive win.</p>
<p>The upcoming final against Hawaii will test the team’s resilience and skill as they seek to claim the West Region title.</p>

<p>Over the past century, attitudes toward cannabis have evolved from strict prohibition and stigmatization toward broader acceptance and legalization. Pop culture has played a significant role in this shift by portraying cannabis use in humorous, positive, and normalized contexts.</p>
<p>Jazz legend Louis Armstrong openly used cannabis, referring to it as “the gage,” and his era’s musicians produced ganja-themed songs. The 1936 film “Reefer Madness,” originally a propaganda piece demonizing cannabis, became a cult classic mocked for its exaggeration.</p>
<p>Musical icons Bob Dylan and The Beatles introduced cannabis to mainstream culture in the 1960s, associating it with counterculture movements. Television shows like “Sanford and Son” in the 1970s portrayed cannabis effects more realistically and kindly.</p>
<p>Reggae artist Bob Marley evangelized cannabis as part of Rastafarian spirituality. Comedic acts Cheech and Chong’s 1978 film “Up in Smoke” helped normalize cannabis use through humor. Snoop Dogg’s involvement in Dr. Dre’s “The Chronic” album in the early 1990s further brought cannabis into mainstream music culture.</p>
<p>Shows like Showtime’s “Weeds” and Netflix’s “Disjointed” explored cannabis use in family and retail contexts, contributing to public discourse. Entrepreneur Berner’s Cookies brand markets cannabis with streetwear aesthetics, helping reshape perceptions.</p>
<p>These cultural moments have helped cannabis transition from a stigmatized substance to a normalized part of American life, accompanying significant legal reforms.</p>
