<p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu publicly defended a newly expanded military offensive in Gaza, describing it as necessary to "finish the job and complete the defeat of Hamas." The security Cabinet authorized operations targeting Hamas strongholds not only in Gaza City but also in the "central camps" and Muwasi, areas sheltering over half a million displaced people according to the United Nations. The expanded offensive plan had not been previously announced, drawing criticism within Netanyahu's ruling coalition for not going far enough.</p>
<p>Netanyahu emphasized that Israel's goal is to "free Gaza" rather than occupy it, aiming to demilitarize the territory, maintain overriding Israeli military security control, and establish a non-Israeli civilian administration. He rejected claims of starvation in Gaza, asserting there was only a shortage and denying any policy of starvation. Netanyahu also announced plans to increase aid distribution sites and to allow more foreign journalists into Gaza, reversing a previous ban on independent reporting beyond military embeds.</p>
<p>The Israeli military confirmed a strike that killed Al Jazeera journalist Anas al-Sharif and three others, accusing al-Sharif of involvement with Hamas, a claim denied by the broadcaster. The United States defended Israel’s right to self-defense during a United Nations Security Council meeting, vetoing resolutions critical of Israel. Meanwhile, China and Russia expressed concern over the humanitarian situation and the escalation of hostilities.</p>
<p>Humanitarian organizations report at least 31 Palestinians were killed while seeking aid amid the conflict, with hospitals describing some aid distribution sites as "death traps." The Gaza Health Ministry reported that the hunger-related death toll among children has reached 100 since the war began. Hostage families in Israel have called for a labor strike next week to protest the expanded military operations, fearing for the safety of their loved ones still held captive by Hamas.</p>

<p>Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy have both maintained uncompromising stances ahead of a planned summit between Putin and U.S. President Donald Trump scheduled for August 15, 2025, in Alaska. Putin aims to use the meeting to secure a broad agreement that would formalize Russia's territorial gains from the 2022 invasion of Ukraine, prevent Ukraine from joining NATO or hosting Western troops, and gradually bring Ukraine back into Russia’s sphere of influence.</p>
<p>Russia’s peace proposal presented in June includes demands for Ukraine to withdraw forces from the annexed regions of Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia, and Kherson, halt mobilization, freeze Western arms deliveries, and hold elections under Moscow’s terms. It also calls for international recognition of Russia’s annexations and Ukraine’s declaration of neutrality, along with restrictions on its armed forces and the recognition of Russian as an official language. Moscow demands the dissolution of nationalist groups and bans on "glorification of Nazism," claims widely dismissed as unfounded by Kyiv and its allies.</p>
<p>Ukraine’s counterproposal insists on a full and unconditional 30-day ceasefire to enable peace talks, rejects Russian territorial claims, and affirms Ukraine’s sovereign right to choose alliances, including NATO membership. Kyiv demands international security guarantees, the return of deported children, and a full prisoner exchange. It remains open to lifting sanctions gradually if Russia complies with agreements.</p>
<p>Trump has expressed willingness to meet Putin without Ukrainian President Zelenskyy present, raising concerns among Ukraine and European allies about potential concessions to Russia. Trump suggested that territorial swaps might be part of a peace deal, though details remain unclear. Analysts warn that Putin could use the summit to gain leverage to pressure Ukraine and sideline European influence. Putin’s foreign affairs adviser stated there have been no changes to Russia’s position, and experts predict peace efforts may fail, leading to continued conflict.</p>

<div class="h2-section-wrapper"><h2>Ukrainian Forces Strike Deep into Russia’s Komi and Saratov Regions Amid Rejection of Ceasefire Proposal</h2><div class="source-indicator-container"><div class="source-item" data-href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/ukraine-war-latest-ukraine-hits-173416329.html"><img class="source-favicon" src="https://www.google.com/s2/favicons?domain=www.yahoo.com" alt="Favicon for www.yahoo.com"></div></div></div>
<p>Ukrainian military intelligence confirmed drone strikes on the Lukoil-Ukhta oil refinery in Russia’s Komi Republic, approximately 2,000 kilometers from the Ukrainian border. The attack targeted facilities supplying fuel and lubricants to Russian forces, causing damage to petroleum tanks and gas processing plants, and leading to local power and internet outages. This marks the first confirmed Ukrainian drone strike in the Komi Republic.</p>
<p>Additionally, drones struck an oil refinery in Saratov Oblast, causing large fires and explosions, with at least one death and multiple injuries reported. Air defense systems were activated in Saratov and other Russian cities including Lipetsk and Voronezh. Ukrainian forces also targeted a storage facility in Tatarstan housing Shahed-type drones and imported parts used in their assembly.</p>
<p>In the Sumy Oblast near the Russian border, Ukrainian forces liberated the village of Bezsalivka, eliminating 18 Russian soldiers according to the Ukrainian General Staff. Fighting continues in the region, with Russian troops attempting to advance deeper into Sumy Oblast.</p>
<p>Ukrainian and European officials have rejected Russian President Vladimir Putin’s ceasefire proposal, which included demands for Ukraine to cede eastern territories. Instead, they presented a counterproposal emphasizing a reciprocal ceasefire and the inclusion of the European Union in peace negotiations. The upcoming summit between U.S. President Donald Trump and Putin is viewed with skepticism by Kyiv and its allies.</p>

<div class="h2-section-wrapper"><h2>Rising Tensions and Violence in West Bank Amid Israeli Settler Expansion Campaign</h2><div class="source-indicator-container"><div class="source-item" data-href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/bowen-israeli-settlers-intensify-campaign-210333535.html"><img class="source-favicon" src="https://www.google.com/s2/favicons?domain=www.yahoo.com" alt="Favicon for www.yahoo.com"></div></div></div>
<p>In the West Bank, Israeli settlers have intensified efforts to expand settlements and displace Palestinian residents, particularly in areas south of Hebron. Meir Simcha, a leader of a settler group known as the "hilltop youth," described the recent period as a "miracle" for Jewish settlement expansion, asserting that Palestinians are losing hope and that the land is destined for Jews. He denied accusations of attacking Palestinians, celebrating the departure of many Arab farmers from the area.</p>
<p>The United Nations has expressed deep concern over widespread intimidation, violence, land dispossession, and forced displacement of Palestinians, warning of systemic human rights violations. Violence by ultra-nationalist Jewish settlers has increased sharply since October 2023, with an average of four settler attacks per day reported by the UN humanitarian office.</p>
<p>The Israeli government, led by figures such as National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir and Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, supports settlement expansion and has taken steps to legalize previously unauthorized outposts. Critics argue that the line between settlers and the Israeli military has blurred, with settlers now forming regional defense units.</p>
<p>The settler movement's religious Zionist faction views the land as divinely ordained for Jews, complicating prospects for peace. Human rights organizations and some Israeli opponents of the occupation warn that current policies risk ethnic cleansing and mass population transfer in the West Bank.</p>

<p>Following recent immigration enforcement raids by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) across Los Angeles and surrounding areas, once-busy immigrant neighborhoods have experienced significant economic and social disruption. Laundromats, clinics, markets, and restaurants have seen drastic drops in patronage as undocumented immigrants and their families stay home out of fear of detention.</p>
<p>Local business owners report closures and reduced hours due to the absence of customers, many of whom are day laborers and service workers. Community leaders emphasize the psychological toll on immigrant families, who now rely on neighbors for essentials and avoid public spaces, including sensitive locations such as churches and schools.</p>
<p>The Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors approved a motion to study the economic impact of the raids on small businesses. Advocates stress the importance of community support and legal aid for affected individuals.</p>
<p>Despite some pauses in enforcement at farms, restaurants, and hotels following concerns about economic damage, federal authorities continue targeting large cities with high immigrant populations. ICE officials defend the raids as focused on dangerous criminals, though community members report widespread fear and allegations of indiscriminate arrests.</p>
<p>Local leaders and immigrant rights organizations have mobilized to provide assistance, including distributing "Know Your Rights" information and organizing support initiatives like "El Monte Cares," which offers food and legal help without questions asked.</p>

<div class="h2-section-wrapper"><h2>Canadian Senator Calls for Transparency on Arms Export Policy Amid Israeli-Palestinian Conflict</h2><div class="source-indicator-container"><div class="source-item" data-href="https://www.theglobeandmail.com/politics/article-canadian-rules-military-exports-to-israel-explained/"><img class="source-favicon" src="https://www.google.com/s2/favicons?domain=www.theglobeandmail.com" alt="Favicon for www.theglobeandmail.com"></div></div></div>
<p>Canadian Senator Yuen Pau Woo has urged the Canadian government to increase transparency regarding its arms export policy to Israel amid conflicting reports about military equipment shipments amid the ongoing conflict in Gaza. While Ottawa insists it has suspended permits for lethal weapons exports to Israel since January 2024 and only allows non-lethal equipment exports, activists and some parliamentarians question the adequacy and enforcement of these restrictions.</p>
<p>Reports have surfaced alleging shipments of bullets, guns, and other military equipment from Canada to Israel, including components potentially used in Israeli fighter jets, drones, and the Iron Dome missile defense system. The government has denied these claims, stating some shipments involved paintball-style projectiles and electronic components for defense systems.</p>
<p>Advocacy groups criticize the vague definition of "non-lethal" and call for a complete halt to military exports to Israel due to concerns over civilian casualties and alleged war crimes. A recent parliamentary report, marked confidential, has been cited by some as contradicting government statements, though officials maintain their position.</p>
<p>Public opinion in Canada appears divided, with a majority supporting restrictions on lethal arms exports to Israel. The government highlights the complexity of military supply chains and the potential impact of a two-way embargo on Canadian defense capabilities.</p>
