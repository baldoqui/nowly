<div class="h2-section-wrapper"><h2>Israel Approves Plan to Take Control of Gaza City Amid Global Condemnation</h2></div>
<p>Israel's security cabinet has approved a plan to take control of Gaza City, escalating its nearly two-year military offensive against Hamas in the Palestinian enclave. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu indicated the intention to take control of all of Gaza, aiming to establish a "security perimeter" before handing governance to Arab forces. The military currently controls around 75% of Gaza, and capturing Gaza City would extend control to approximately 85% of the territory.</p>
<p>The decision has drawn widespread criticism internationally. The United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres described it as a dangerous escalation risking further displacement, killings, and destruction, worsening the humanitarian crisis for millions of Palestinians. Forced displacement violates international law. The United Nations Security Council is scheduled to hold an emergency meeting to discuss the situation. Several countries, including Germany, Britain, France, Saudi Arabia, and Pakistan, condemned the plan, urging Israel to reconsider and calling for a ceasefire.</p>
<p>Germany responded by suspending exports of military equipment that could be used in Gaza "until further notice," marking a significant shift from its longstanding support for Israel. Chancellor Friedrich Merz emphasized Israel's right to self-defense but expressed concern over the humanitarian impact and called for the release of hostages and purposeful ceasefire negotiations. European leaders, including EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, echoed calls for de-escalation.</p>
<p>Within Israel, the plan has also faced criticism from opposition leaders and families of hostages held by Hamas, who fear the operation could endanger the lives of the remaining captives. The Israeli military chief of staff warned that a full occupation could strain military resources and jeopardize hostages.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, humanitarian conditions in Gaza remain dire. Israeli air and ground operations have killed tens of thousands of Palestinians and displaced most of the population, pushing the territory toward famine. Aid delivery faces significant obstacles, with reports of Palestinians killed while seeking humanitarian assistance at aid distribution points.</p>
<p>Efforts by mediators from Egypt and Qatar aim to draft a framework for ending the conflict, including the release of all hostages in exchange for Israeli withdrawal and a ceasefire. The plan envisions a Palestinian-Arab committee overseeing Gaza and reconstruction until a new Palestinian administration is established.</p>

<div class="h2-section-wrapper"><h2>Trump Hosts Armenia-Azerbaijan Peace Summit, Announces 'Trump Route' Transit Corridor</h2></div>
<p>President Donald Trump convened a peace summit at the White House with the leaders of Armenia and Azerbaijan, aiming to end nearly four decades of conflict in the South Caucasus region. The two countries signed an agreement establishing a major transit corridor, named the "Trump Route for International Peace and Prosperity," connecting Azerbaijan with its autonomous Nakhchivan exclave, which is separated by Armenian territory. This corridor had been a contentious issue in prior peace talks.</p>
<p>The deal is seen as a geopolitical setback for Russia, which had traditionally mediated the conflict to maintain influence in the region. Russia's influence has waned following its 2022 invasion of Ukraine. Both Armenia and Azerbaijan also signed separate energy, technology, and economic agreements with the United States.</p>
<p>During the summit, Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan and Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev praised Trump’s leadership, with both suggesting he deserves a Nobel Peace Prize. Trump expressed that winning the prize would be an honor but emphasized his focus is on saving lives and peace efforts, including involvement in Ukraine and Russia.</p>
<p>Trump announced plans to meet "very shortly" with Russian President Vladimir Putin to discuss the war in Ukraine, expressing optimism about a potential peace deal between Russia and Ukraine.</p>
<p>Separately, a federal judge temporarily blocked the Trump administration’s attempt to impose conditions on domestic violence grants that restrict references to gender ideology, diversity, or participation by undocumented individuals, ruling the conditions arbitrary and harmful to service providers.</p>

<div class="h2-section-wrapper"><h2>Jim Lovell, Apollo 13 Commander and Space Exploration Pioneer, Dies at 97</h2></div>
<p>Jim Lovell, the celebrated astronaut who commanded the Apollo 13 mission, passed away on August 7 in Lake Forest, Illinois, at the age of 97. NASA announced his death without disclosing the cause.</p>
<p>Lovell was a pivotal figure in space exploration history. He served as Command Module Pilot for Apollo 8, the first mission to orbit the Moon, and later commanded Apollo 13 in 1970. The Apollo 13 mission, intended to land on the Moon, suffered a critical oxygen tank explosion but was famously termed a "successful failure" due to the crew’s safe return to Earth under Lovell's calm and skilled leadership.</p>
<p>Acting NASA Administrator Sean Duffy praised Lovell's quick thinking and innovation, which have inspired generations of astronauts and space enthusiasts. Lovell’s legacy is marked by his leadership during crises and his contributions to the advancement of human spaceflight.</p>
<p>Details about memorial services are yet to be announced.</p>

<div class="h2-section-wrapper"><h2>California Democrats Push for Special Election Amid Redistricting Battle with Texas Republicans</h2></div>
<p>California Democrats, led by Governor Gavin Newsom, are accelerating efforts to schedule a special election to redraw congressional districts in response to Texas Republicans' redistricting moves. Texas recently passed new maps favoring the GOP by adding five Republican-leaning seats and removing five Democratic-leaning ones, intensifying a national political battle over electoral advantage.</p>
<p>Newsom proposes temporarily setting aside California's independent redistricting commission to implement a new map that could similarly increase Democratic seats, aiming to counterbalance Texas's gains. The plan faces a tight timeline, with the legislature returning from recess mid-August and the November election approaching.</p>
<p>California's independent redistricting commission, created by voter initiative in 2008 and 2010, is designed to draw fair districts by a bipartisan panel of citizens rather than politicians. Newsom acknowledges the temporary nature of his proposal and supports independent redistricting as a national model but stresses the need to respond to partisan gerrymandering elsewhere.</p>
<p>This redistricting dispute reflects a broader national contest, with Republicans in several states considering similar maneuvers. However, many Democratic-controlled states with independent commissions face legal and constitutional hurdles to redrawing maps mid-cycle.</p>

<div class="h2-section-wrapper"><h2>Louisville City FC's Josh Jones Emerges as Key Player in USL Championship</h2></div>
<p>Josh Jones, a 2021 graduate of North Penn High School and University of Louisville standout, has become a key defender for Louisville City FC in the USL Championship during his rookie professional season. Jones, 22, has started four consecutive matches, contributing to a 3-0-1 stretch that helped LouCity tie for first place in the USL Eastern Conference.</p>
<p>Jones was selected 47th overall in the 2024 MLS Draft by Real Salt Lake but chose to complete his senior college year before turning professional. Louisville City FC, a successful USL team with two championships in recent years, offered him a one-year contract, which he accepted.</p>
<p>Known for his height (6-foot-5), athleticism, and high soccer IQ, Jones has excelled in defensive clearances, duels won, and passing accuracy. He has also developed a long-throw-in specialty used as an offensive weapon. Jones credits coach Danny Cruz and veteran teammates for fostering a competitive and supportive environment.</p>
<p>While Jones aspires to join an MLS roster, he is focused on helping Louisville City FC secure a USL Cup title this season. He regards Louisville as a second home and anticipates difficulty leaving the city if he advances to higher professional levels.</p>
