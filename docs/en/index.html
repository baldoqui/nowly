<p>President Donald Trump announced intentions to mobilize Washington, D.C.'s National Guard and take control of its local police force, suggesting that other liberal-leaning cities such as Chicago, Los Angeles, New York, Baltimore, and Oakland could be next. All these cities are led by Black Democratic mayors who have strongly opposed Trump's plans, citing that violent crime rates in their cities have reached historic lows.</p>
<p>Baltimore Mayor Brandon Scott highlighted a 28% decrease in homicides this year, calling Baltimore the safest it has been in over 50 years. Oakland Mayor Barbara Lee and New York City Mayor Eric Adams declared they would not permit federal law enforcement to take over their jurisdictions. Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson stated that Trump lacks the authority to federalize local law enforcement and criticized the president for provoking federal troop deployments that lack policing power.</p>
<p>Legal experts, including NYU Law Professor Rick Hills, noted that Trump's actions in D.C. cannot be legally replicated in other cities due to state autonomy doctrines. Civil rights organizations warned that Trump's moves in D.C. could be a "beta test" for broader authoritarian control nationwide.</p>
<p>Despite Trump's claims of "out of control" crime, data from the Metropolitan Police in D.C. shows violent crime is at a 30-year low and down 26% from the previous year. Similar crime reductions were reported in the other cities mentioned. Mayors expressed willingness to collaborate with the federal government on violence prevention but rejected militarized interventions, emphasizing the need for funding and policies such as federal gun control legislation.</p>

<p>Russian President Vladimir Putin praised U.S. President Donald Trump’s efforts to end the war in Ukraine ahead of their scheduled summit in Anchorage, Alaska. Putin acknowledged the Trump administration’s “energetic and sincere efforts” to halt hostilities and suggested that long-term peace conditions could be reached, including agreements on nuclear arms control.</p>
<p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy met with British Prime Minister Keir Starmer in London to coordinate positions before the summit. European leaders expressed cautious optimism but remained concerned that the bilateral U.S.-Russia talks might sideline Ukraine and favor Moscow. German Chancellor Friedrich Merz and French President Emmanuel Macron welcomed the video conference with Trump but emphasized the importance of protecting Ukraine’s territorial integrity.</p>
<p>Trump indicated that any deal would likely come from a trilateral summit involving Zelenskyy following the U.S.-Russia meeting. He warned of “very severe consequences” for Russia if it did not agree to a ceasefire. Kremlin officials tempered expectations, stating no documents were planned to be signed and cautioning against predicting the summit’s outcome.</p>
<p>In parallel, a United Arab Emirates-mediated prisoner exchange resulted in the release of 168 prisoners of war between Russia and Ukraine. Meanwhile, Russian forces intercepted numerous Ukrainian drones, and both sides reported injuries from recent strikes.</p>

<div class="h2-section-wrapper"><h2>U.S. Special Forces at Fort Bragg Linked to Drug Trafficking and Murders, New Book Reveals</h2><div class="source-indicator-container"><div class="source-item" data-href="https://www.democracynow.org/2025/8/14/fort_bragg_cartel_seth_harp"><img class="source-favicon" src="https://www.google.com/s2/favicons?domain=www.democracynow.org" alt="Favicon for www.democracynow.org"></div><div class="source-item" data-href="https://thebaffler.com/latest/pipe-hitters-scott"><img class="source-favicon" src="https://www.google.com/s2/favicons?domain=thebaffler.com" alt="Favicon for thebaffler.com"></div></div></div>
<p>Investigative reporting and a new book, <em>The Fort Bragg Cartel: Drug Trafficking and Murder in the Special Forces</em> by Seth Harp, expose involvement of elite U.S. Army Special Forces, including Delta Force operators based at Fort Bragg, North Carolina, in narcotics trafficking and violent crimes.</p>
<p>The book details multiple cases over recent years of Fort Bragg-trained soldiers arrested, killed, or implicated in drug trafficking, often in connection with Mexican cartels such as Los Zetas, which were initially trained by U.S. Special Forces. The investigation highlights systemic issues of corruption, drug abuse, and violence within the military base and surrounding community.</p>
<p>Notably, two Delta Force members were found murdered on base in 2020, linked to drug deals gone wrong. The author also connects U.S. military intervention abroad, particularly in Afghanistan, with the stimulation of drug production and trafficking, where warlords on the U.S. payroll profited from heroin manufacturing during the occupation.</p>
<p>The report raises concerns about the militarization of covert operations, lack of oversight on Special Forces, and the impact of such activities domestically and internationally. The book suggests that the culture of violence and illicit activity among operators extends beyond the battlefield into their home communities.</p>

<div class="h2-section-wrapper"><h2>Rising Environmental Concerns as Mexico Launches Plan to Clean Polluted Rivers</h2><div class="source-indicator-container"><div class="source-item" data-href="https://cen.acs.org/environment/pollution/its-like-fighting-Goliath-clean-Mexico-rivers/103/web/2025/08"><img class="source-favicon" src="https://www.google.com/s2/favicons?domain=cen.acs.org" alt="Favicon for cen.acs.org"></div></div></div>
<p>Mexico has initiated a national water plan targeting the restoration of heavily polluted rivers, including the Atoyac River basin in Tlaxcala and Puebla. The plan, announced by former President Claudia Sheinbaum, includes enforcing environmental laws, upgrading water treatment facilities, reforestation, and creating riverfront parks.</p>
<p>Despite these efforts, local communities and scientists remain skeptical due to decades of pollution caused by industrial and municipal discharges, lax enforcement, and political obstacles. Studies have found elevated levels of toxic heavy metals and chemicals in residents, correlating with increased health problems such as cancer and renal failure.</p>
<p>The government allocated over 200 million pesos (approximately $10.5 million) for treatment plants and sewage infrastructure, but critics note insufficient inter-agency coordination and underfunding of regulatory bodies. Activists emphasize the need for updated laws, community involvement, and sustained long-term commitment to address the deep-rooted environmental degradation.</p>

<div class="h2-section-wrapper"><h2>Rebel Control of Congo’s Rubaya Coltan Mines Raises Conflict and Investment Concerns</h2><div class="source-indicator-container"><div class="source-item" data-href="https://www.bizcommunity.com/article/the-hidden-cost-of-your-smartphone-inside-congo-rebel-funded-mines-957684a"><img class="source-favicon" src="https://www.google.com/s2/favicons?domain=www.bizcommunity.com" alt="Favicon for www.bizcommunity.com"></div></div></div>
<p>The M23 rebel group controls the mineral-rich Rubaya coltan mines in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), a key source of tantalum used in electronics worldwide. The rebels have established a parallel administration taxing mineral traders and controlling mining operations. This has increased efficiency in ore transport but raised concerns about funding ongoing conflict and human rights abuses, including child labor.</p>
<p>The U.S. Treasury sanctioned a pro-government militia formerly controlling the mine but has not extended sanctions to M23, possibly to support ongoing peace talks mediated by Qatar. The conflict threatens regional stability, with M23 controlling strategic border cities facilitating illicit mineral trade into Rwanda.</p>
<p>U.S. investors, including associates of President Trump, have shown interest in developing the Rubaya mine, prompting scrutiny from lawmakers over transparency and conflict of interest. The success of peace negotiations and stabilization efforts in the region is crucial for enabling formal investment and development of Congo’s vast mineral resources.</p>
