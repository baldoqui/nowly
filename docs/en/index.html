<p>U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin met in Anchorage, Alaska, for nearly three hours in the first summit since the full-scale invasion of Ukraine began in February 2022. The meeting concluded with no ceasefire deal or comprehensive peace agreement, though both leaders described the talks as productive and noted progress on several issues. Trump emphasized that while "many points" were agreed upon, "there's no deal until there's a deal."</p>
<p>Trump shifted his stance by advocating for a direct peace agreement rather than a preliminary ceasefire, aligning with Putin's long-held position. He indicated discussions included potential land swaps and security guarantees for Ukraine, proposals that have sparked concern among European leaders and analysts. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who was not invited to the summit, is scheduled to meet Trump in Washington to discuss the conflict further.</p>
<p>European leaders expressed disappointment over the summit's lack of concrete outcomes, reaffirming support for Ukraine and calling for continued pressure on Russia. Meanwhile, Russia launched multiple drone and missile attacks on Ukrainian territory overnight following the summit.</p>
<p>Putin extended an invitation to Trump for a future meeting in Moscow, which Trump acknowledged might face domestic criticism but did not rule out. Both leaders refrained from taking questions during the joint press appearance, underscoring the cautious nature of the engagement.</p>

<p>Deere &amp; Company announced its third quarter fiscal 2025 earnings, reporting earnings per share of $4.75, surpassing expectations of $4.57. Despite a 9% year-over-year decline in net sales to $12.018 billion, the company maintained a strong operating margin of 12.6%. The agricultural and turf equipment sectors saw mixed demand, with better-than-expected retail sales in North America and Europe, while global uncertainty and trade tensions continue to affect customer sentiment.</p>
<p>Deere highlighted significant inventory reductions across all business units and geographies, positioning the company to respond to market demand inflections. The firm also noted ongoing challenges from tariffs, which are expected to total approximately $600 million in pretax costs for fiscal 2025, primarily driven by increased rates on Europe, India, steel, and aluminum.</p>
<p>Looking ahead, Deere anticipates industry sales declines in large agricultural equipment in the U.S. and Canada of about 30% for the fiscal year, with small agricultural and turf markets down approximately 10%. The company remains optimistic about growth opportunities in Europe, South America, and Asia, particularly India.</p>

<p>Russia hosted its first official meeting with the defense ministers of Burkina Faso, Mali, and Niger, countries led by military juntas that have distanced themselves from former colonial power France and aligned more closely with Moscow. The meeting culminated in the signing of a memorandum of understanding on defense cooperation.</p>
<p>The Russian defense minister highlighted defense as the largest area of cooperation, with Russia pledging comprehensive assistance to ensure stability in the Sahel region, which faces a growing jihadist insurgency. The three Sahelian states formed the Alliance of Sahel States (AES) earlier this year, positioning themselves as a counterbalance to the pro-Western Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS).</p>
<p>This development underscores Russia's expanding influence in Africa amid its international isolation following the Ukraine conflict.</p>

<div class="h2-section-wrapper"><h2>Palestinian Youth Movement’s “Mask Off Maersk” Campaign Pressures Shipping Giant on Arms Transfers</h2><div class="source-indicator-container"><div class="source-item" data-href="https://truthout.org/articles/palestinian-youth-movement-vows-to-make-genocide-support-too-costly-for-maersk/"><img class="source-favicon" src="https://www.google.com/s2/favicons?domain=truthout.org" alt="Favicon for truthout.org"></div></div></div>
<p>The Palestinian Youth Movement (PYM) successfully pressured Danish shipping company Maersk to cease commercial dealings with companies operating in illegal Israeli settlements. PYM’s “Mask Off Maersk” campaign exposed Maersk’s role in transporting military cargo, including parts for Israeli F-35 fighter jets used in Gaza bombings.</p>
<p>Through detailed research, public reports, and direct actions such as protests and shareholder resolutions, PYM highlighted Maersk’s complicity in the ongoing genocide in Gaza. Labor unions in France and Morocco also took action by refusing to handle Israel-bound shipments.</p>
<p>The campaign demonstrates the potential of grassroots activism to enforce arms embargoes and disrupt supply chains contributing to human rights violations, especially where international legal mechanisms have fallen short.</p>
