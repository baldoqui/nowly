<p>McDonald’s Japan has canceled its recent Happy Meal campaign, known locally as Happy Sets, which included highly sought-after Pokemon cards and toys such as plastic Pikachu figures. The campaign, intended for children, saw the meals sell out within a day, attracting large crowds and resellers who purchased the meals primarily for the collectible cards. Unfortunately, many buyers discarded the actual food, leaving significant amounts of waste and trash outside McDonald’s stores.</p>
<p>In response, McDonald’s Japan issued an apology, stating that the situation contradicted their longstanding philosophy of providing a fun dining experience for children and families without food wastage. The company acknowledged inadequate preparations and announced plans to limit the number of meals per customer and end online orders to prevent recurrence. They also indicated potential refusal of service to customers who violate these rules. The collectible Pokemon cards have a substantial market value, with some selling for hundreds to thousands of dollars online.</p>
<p>Separately, the campaign highlights ongoing challenges faced by restaurant chains globally, including operational disruptions from the COVID-19 pandemic, inflationary pressures, and shifting consumer habits. Despite such challenges, chain restaurants remain integral to American dining culture and the economy, with projections to add nearly 500,000 seasonal jobs in summer 2025.</p>

<p>U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin are scheduled to meet in Alaska, marking the latest chapter in the state’s complex history with Russia. Alaska’s proximity to Russia, with the Bering Strait separating the two nations by less than three miles at certain points, adds symbolic weight to the summit hosted at Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson in Anchorage. The base has historical significance from the Cold War era and remains a key military installation monitoring Russian activities.</p>
<p>The summit comes amid ongoing conflict in Ukraine, with Putin’s 2022 invasion aiming to reassert Russian influence over Kyiv and other territories. Despite initial expectations of a swift victory, Russia has controlled only a portion of Ukrainian territory after more than three years of war. U.S. efforts under Trump’s administration include pushing for a peace deal, though skepticism remains about Putin’s willingness to negotiate a genuine ceasefire.</p>
<p>Local sentiment in Alaska has turned against Russia following the invasion, with sister city relationships suspended and public rallies planned against Putin. Critics argue that holding the summit in Alaska sends a problematic message, with concerns that Putin might use historical precedents like the sale of Alaska to justify territorial claims in Ukraine.</p>
<p>The summit is expected to focus on security issues, with Alaska’s strategic location underscoring ongoing geopolitical tensions between the U.S. and Russia.</p>

<div class="h2-section-wrapper"><h2>Ukraine’s Former Foreign Minister Warns of No Peace While Putin Remains in Power</h2><div class="source-indicator-container"><div class="source-item" data-href="https://www.northwestmoinfo.com/syndicated-article/?id=1632290"><img class="source-favicon" src="https://www.google.com/s2/favicons?domain=www.northwestmoinfo.com" alt="Favicon for www.northwestmoinfo.com"></div></div></div>
<p>Dmytro Kuleba, Ukraine’s ex-foreign minister, expressed a bleak outlook on the prospects for peace in Ukraine, stating that he does not foresee an end to the war during Russian President Vladimir Putin’s lifetime. Speaking from Kyiv, Kuleba emphasized that while a ceasefire might be possible, it would only serve as a temporary pause rather than a resolution.</p>
<p>Kuleba highlighted Putin’s strategic goal of subjugating Ukraine and his unwillingness to relinquish ambitions of empire-building, viewing the conflict as a legacy issue for the Russian leader. He criticized the West for insufficient support to Ukraine despite significant aid, and he voiced skepticism about the upcoming U.S.-Russia summit in Alaska, cautioning that Putin only responds to force.</p>
<p>The former minister also discussed Ukraine’s red lines in negotiations, including refusal to recognize Russian territorial gains, maintain a strong military, and uphold aspirations for NATO membership enshrined in the constitution. Kuleba warned of potential political challenges in Ukraine post-war, with veterans expected to demand a greater role in governance.</p>

<p>Residents in a Los Angeles neighborhood are calling for intervention after enduring months of loud train horn blasts from a neighbor, Gary Boyadzhian, 50, who has installed a train horn on his roof. He reportedly sounds the horn up to three times daily in an attempt to get the attention of the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD).</p>
<p>Neighbors described the noise as “piercing” and “horrific,” with windows rattling and disturbances occurring at all hours. Boyadzhian acknowledged the impact on his neighbors but cited the noise as a cry for help without providing further details about his dispute with the LAPD.</p>
<p>Despite residents posting signs urging others to report the noise, police have been unable to catch Boyadzhian in the act due to delayed response times. Officers have informed residents that citations require firsthand witnessing of the disturbances. The LAPD’s Van Nuys division is currently consulting with the city attorney on potential actions to address the ongoing issue.</p>

<div class="h2-section-wrapper"><h2>Experts Discuss Pope Leo XIV’s First 100 Days and Vatican Diplomacy in Global Affairs</h2><div class="source-indicator-container"><div class="source-item" data-href="https://www.cfr.org/event/religion-and-foreign-policy-webinar-pope-leo-xivs-first-100-days"><img class="source-favicon" src="https://www.google.com/s2/favicons?domain=www.cfr.org" alt="Favicon for www.cfr.org"></div></div></div>
<p>A webinar hosted by the Council on Foreign Relations examined Pope Leo XIV’s initial 100 days as head of the Catholic Church, focusing on his background, diplomatic style, and potential influence on international relations. Panelists included Dr. Stephen Schneck, Father Tom Reese, and George Weigel.</p>
<p>The pope’s American upbringing, particularly his Chicago roots, was noted as shaping his approachable style and international outlook, enhanced by extensive missionary experience in Peru and Italy. Panelists highlighted that Vatican diplomacy is a longstanding, consistent institution with a focus on peace, humanitarian work, and multilateral engagement.</p>
<p>Pope Leo’s emphasis on peace was evident in his early remarks and actions, including engagement with the Ukrainian church amid the ongoing war. The discussion addressed his potential impact on U.S.-Vatican relations, which are expected to remain professional but may experience tensions over differing foreign policy priorities, especially in humanitarian aid and climate change.</p>
<p>The panel also explored the pope’s approach to ecumenism, interreligious dialogue, and the role of laity and women in the church. Pope Leo is seen as continuing reforms initiated by his predecessors, promoting greater lay participation and addressing contemporary issues such as artificial intelligence with a moral framework.</p>
<p>Overall, the pope’s tenure is viewed as a return to a more stable and traditional Vatican diplomatic approach, balancing moral witness with pragmatic engagement in global affairs.</p>
