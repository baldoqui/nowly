<div class="h2-section-wrapper"><h2>Canadian Natural Reports Strong Q2 2025 Financial and Operational Results</h2><div class="source-indicator-container"><div class="source-item" data-href="https://www.newsfilecorp.com/release/261613"><img class="source-favicon" src="https://www.google.com/s2/favicons?domain=www.newsfilecorp.com" alt="Favicon for www.newsfilecorp.com"></div></div></div>
<p>Canadian Natural Resources Limited (TSX: CNQ) announced robust financial and operational performance for the second quarter of 2025. Despite a planned turnaround at the Athabasca Oil Sands Project (AOSP) that reduced production by approximately 120,000 barrels per day during the quarter, the company achieved total production volumes of about 1.42 million barrels of oil equivalent per day (BOE/d). This includes 1.019 million barrels per day of liquids and 2,407 million cubic feet per day of natural gas.</p>
<p>The company reported net earnings of approximately CAD 2.46 billion for Q2, with adjusted net earnings from operations at CAD 1.5 billion. Adjusted funds flow reached CAD 3.3 billion, supporting CAD 1.6 billion in shareholder returns through dividends and share repurchases. Canadian Natural maintained a strong balance sheet with liquidity of CAD 4.8 billion as of June 30, 2025, and a recent BBB+ credit rating from Fitch.</p>
<p>Operational highlights include increased drilling activity, with a target to drill 182 net primary heavy crude oil multilateral wells in 2025, 26 more than originally budgeted. Production growth was supported by accretive acquisitions, including the recent purchase of liquids-rich Montney assets near Grande Prairie, Alberta, adding approximately 32,000 BOE/d. The company also reported cost efficiencies, particularly in the Duvernay assets, where operating costs decreased by 11% quarter-over-quarter.</p>
<p>Canadian Natural continues to focus on a balanced portfolio of long-life, low-decline assets combined with low capital exposure projects, aiming to deliver sustainable free cash flow and shareholder value throughout commodity price cycles.</p>

<div class="h2-section-wrapper"><h2>Desert Gold Ventures Releases Positive Preliminary Economic Assessment for Mali Gold Project</h2><div class="source-indicator-container"><div class="source-item" data-href="https://www.newsfilecorp.com/release/261501"><img class="source-favicon" src="https://www.google.com/s2/favicons?domain=www.newsfilecorp.com" alt="Favicon for www.newsfilecorp.com"></div></div></div>
<p>Desert Gold Ventures Inc. (TSXV: DAU) published the results of its maiden Preliminary Economic Assessment (PEA) for the Barani and Gourbassi deposits within its 100%-owned SMSZ Gold Project in western Mali. The study outlines a low-capital, open-pit oxide mining operation with an expected mine life exceeding 17 years.</p>
<p>Key economic metrics at a base gold price of USD 2,500 per ounce include an after-tax Net Present Value (NPV) at a 10% discount rate of USD 24 million, an Internal Rate of Return (IRR) of 34%, and a payback period of 3.25 years. At the current spot price of USD 3,366 per ounce, the NPV increases to USD 54 million with an IRR of 64%.</p>
<p>The project plans to produce approximately 5,500 ounces of gold annually from an average processing throughput of 18,300 tonnes per month. The operation will use a modular gravity and carbon-in-leach (CIL) processing plant, initially at Barani and later relocated to Gourbassi, optimizing capital expenditures.</p>
<p>The PEA incorporates measured and indicated resources of 11.12 million tonnes grading 0.94 g/t gold (336,800 ounces) and inferred resources of 27.16 million tonnes grading 1.01 g/t gold (879,900 ounces). The study focuses on oxide and transitional mineralization, excluding deeper sulfide resources which present further exploration potential.</p>
<p>Desert Gold is advancing funding discussions to commence construction and plans additional drilling to expand known gold zones. The project benefits from established infrastructure and favorable mining conditions in the region.</p>

<p>On August 7, 2025, US President Donald Trump signed an executive order imposing an additional 25% tariff on Indian imports of Russian oil, bringing the total US tariff on such imports to 50%. The tariffs will take effect 21 days after signing, allowing a window for potential negotiations.</p>
<p>The Indian government condemned the move as "unfortunate," "unfair, unjustified and unreasonable," emphasizing that its purchases of Russian oil are based on market factors and aimed at ensuring energy security for its population of 1.4 billion.</p>
<p>Trade experts warn the tariffs could significantly impact India-US trade relations, potentially reducing Indian exports to the US by 40-50%. The tariffs have sparked political criticism within India, with opposition parties highlighting the economic strain on the country.</p>
<p>The tariff action contrasts with the US approach to China, which faces a 30% tariff, and follows ongoing tensions related to India's non-compliance with Ukraine-related sanctions. India remains a key US partner but faces complex geopolitical considerations due to its energy and defense ties with Russia.</p>
<p>Separately, the US also imposed a 100% tariff on computer chips to incentivize domestic production, exempting companies manufacturing chips in the US.</p>

<div class="h2-section-wrapper"><h2>Lithuanian Citizen Partners with FSB General’s Wife in Russian Quarrying Business</h2><div class="source-indicator-container"><div class="source-item" data-href="https://www.lrt.lt/en/news-in-english/19/2635070/russian-business-ties-between-lithuanain-citizen-and-fsb-general-lrt-investigation"><img class="source-favicon" src="https://www.google.com/s2/favicons?domain=www.lrt.lt" alt="Favicon for www.lrt.lt"></div></div></div>
<p>Investigative reporting by LRT and The Insider reveals that a Lithuanian citizen, Aleksandras Patutinas, is involved in a quarrying business in Russia alongside Olga Stepygina, the wife of Albert Stepygin, a general in the Federal Security Service (FSB) of Russia. The business operates under Aleksnerud LLC, which holds licenses to extract sand, gravel, and kaolin in Russia’s Vladimir region.</p>
<p>Albert Stepygin heads the FSB’s 2nd Directorate of Internal Security, a secretive department responsible for internal investigations within the FSB. Despite his official role, evidence suggests he is involved in commercial activities through his wife’s business interests.</p>
<p>Patutinas, originally from Kaliningrad and a Lithuanian citizen since the USSR’s dissolution, has retained his Lithuanian passport and continues to travel to Lithuania, including visits to his family in Visaginas. His relatives include an engineer employed at the Ignalina Nuclear Power Plant in Lithuania.</p>
<p>The quarrying venture is reportedly overseen by Sergei Morozov, a figure linked to illegal timber trade and with close ties to the FSB. The business has faced local complaints but maintains protection due to its connections.</p>
<p>The investigation also connects General Stepygin to controversial cases, including the disappearance of Vladimir Antonov, a Lithuanian banker with ties to Russian organized crime.</p>

<p>US Vice-President JD Vance will begin his UK "MAGA summer" holiday with a visit to Chevening House, the official residence of the UK Foreign Secretary David Lammy, located in Kent. The visit marks a continuation of an unusual friendship between Lammy, a Labour Party member, and Vance, a Republican, based on shared backgrounds and religious faith.</p>
<p>The Vance family is expected to stay one night at Chevening House before moving to the Cotswolds, a region popular among affluent Americans seeking a traditional English countryside experience. The visit will include a formal bilateral meeting between Lammy and Vance, likely covering topics such as Ukraine, Gaza, trade, and technology.</p>
<p>Lammy and Vance have bonded over similar personal histories, including being raised in fatherless households and their Christian faith. Their relationship has grown despite differing political views, with Lammy describing Vance as a friend.</p>
<p>The visit comes amid planned protests from groups opposing Vance and former US President Donald Trump’s upcoming state visit to the UK.</p>
