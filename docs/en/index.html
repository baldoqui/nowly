<p>Their Majesties King Charles III and Queen Camilla led a national Service of Remembrance at the National Memorial Arboretum in Staffordshire on August 15, marking the 80th anniversary of Victory over Japan (VJ Day).

<p>On August 15, U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin met at Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson in Anchorage, Alaska, for a highly anticipated summit focused on the ongoing war in Ukraine. This was their first face-to-face meeting since 2019 and Putin's first with a U.S. president since the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine.</p>
<p>President Trump expressed optimism ahead of the talks, stating he believed Putin wanted peace and that a deal could be reached, estimating a 75% chance of success. Trump indicated the summit was a preliminary meeting, with the possibility of a follow-up trilateral meeting including Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and European leaders. However, Trump clarified he was not negotiating on behalf of Ukraine and ruled out discussions about Ukraine joining NATO.</p>
<p>The summit occurred amid ongoing hostilities, with Russia launching drone strikes across Ukraine overnight, resulting in civilian casualties. Ukrainian officials reported seven civilians killed and 17 injured. Ukraine also conducted drone attacks on Russian targets, with Russia claiming to have shot down dozens of drones.</p>
<p>Putin praised the Trump administration's efforts to end the war and suggested the talks might cover broader issues, including strategic offensive arms control and economic cooperation. The meeting began with a private conversation between the two leaders, followed by a delegation meeting and a planned joint press conference.</p>
<p>The summit drew protests from Ukraine supporters in Anchorage, and Ukrainian President Zelenskyy emphasized the need for a genuine peace process involving Ukraine directly.</p>


<div class="h2-section-wrapper"><h2>Belgium's Foreign Minister Urges Immediate Recognition of Palestine</h2><div class="source-indicator-container"><div class="source-item" data-href="https://www.thenationalnews.com/news/europe/2025/08/15/belgiums-foreign-minister-urges-palestine-recognition-before-there-is-nothing-left/"><img class="source-favicon" src="https://www.google.com/s2/favicons?domain=www.thenationalnews.com" alt="Favicon for www.thenationalnews.com"></div></div></div>
<p>Belgium’s Foreign Minister Maxime Prevot called on the Belgian government to swiftly recognize the state of Palestine, warning that failure to do so by September would result in there being "nothing left to recognize." Speaking during an emergency parliamentary debate on August 14, Prevot stressed that recognition is essential to maintain Belgium's credibility in advocating for a two-state solution amid the worsening humanitarian crisis in Gaza.</p>
<p>Prevot also advocated for economic sanctions against Israel and proposed placing Israeli far-right ministers Itamar Ben Gvir and Bezalel Smotrich on a Belgian blacklist banning their entry, aligning with similar sanctions by the UK, Norway, and other countries. He emphasized that recognition would strengthen the Palestinian Authority and peaceful efforts, not reward Hamas.</p>
<p>The debate highlighted divisions within Belgium’s coalition government, with some parties supporting rapid recognition of Palestine while others oppose it, citing concerns about the lack of conditions and the ineffectiveness of sanctions without U.S. support. Prime Minister Bart De Wever, currently on holiday, has not convened a cabinet meeting on the issue. Prevot pledged to mobilize coalition allies to advance recognition ahead of the UN General Assembly in September.</p>
<p>Additionally, Prevot announced a draft Royal Decree to tighten Belgium’s arms export ban, prohibiting arms shipments to Israel or Palestine from crossing Belgian airspace, including overflights.</p>

<div class="h2-section-wrapper"><h2>UN in Geneva Faces Crisis Amid Massive Job Cuts and Funding Withdrawals</h2><div class="source-indicator-container"><div class="source-item" data-href="https://lenews.ch/2025/08/15/international-geneva-in-crisis-where-do-we-go-from-here/"><img class="source-favicon" src="https://www.google.com/s2/favicons?domain=lenews.ch" alt="Favicon for lenews.ch"></div></div></div>
<p>Geneva, Switzerland, home to numerous United Nations agencies and international organizations, is experiencing an unprecedented crisis due to large-scale budget cuts and job losses. The UN80 initiative, launched in March 2025 to improve efficiency, has evolved into the largest workforce reduction in UN history, with over 20,000 UN jobs and more than 30,000 jobs in the broader International Geneva community expected to be eliminated.</p>
<p>The crisis is driven largely by significant funding withdrawals, notably from the United States, which has cut $9 billion in foreign aid, including contributions to key UN agencies such as UNICEF, UNDP, and UNESCO. The Trump administration has also withdrawn from several UN bodies, including the Human Rights Council and WHO, and has taken a parochial approach to international cooperation.</p>
<p>The cuts come at a time of increasing global crises, including conflicts in Gaza, Ukraine, and Sudan, and growing climate change challenges. The reductions are impacting humanitarian operations, vaccine programs, and refugee assistance, raising concerns about the UN’s capacity to respond effectively.</p>
<p>Geneva’s local economy, heavily reliant on the international sector, faces severe repercussions from the downsizing, with many UN staff losing residence permits and being forced to leave. Swiss authorities have established emergency funds to mitigate the impact, but experts warn that without innovative reforms and renewed international support, Geneva’s status as a global diplomatic and humanitarian hub is at risk.</p>

<p>Rockland County legislators unanimously approved the 2025-2026 budget for Rockland Community College (RCC), maintaining a nearly flat increase of 0.2% to $61.85 million. The county, as the college’s local sponsor, will contribute approximately $18 million, about one-third of the total budget. Tuition rates will remain unchanged, and the college aims to increase enrollment slightly from the current 3,680 full-time students.</p>
<p>The budget maintains a $1.5 million fund balance to cover unexpected expenses and support cash flow. County officials expressed optimism that new leadership at RCC will stabilize finances and foster growth.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, healthcare workers at Rockland Pulmonary, part of the WMCHealth network, began a strike on August 12, demanding fair wages, better benefits, and an end to alleged management intimidation during contract negotiations. The union 1199SEIU filed charges against WMCHealth for violating federal labor laws. Workers cited threats of office closures, refusal to bargain in good faith, and pressure to quit as reasons for the strike.</p>
<p>Community and elected leaders attended the strike to show support. The dispute highlights ongoing labor tensions in the healthcare sector amid efforts to secure equitable contracts and working conditions.</p>
