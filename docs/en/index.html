<p>The United States is intensifying economic pressure on Russia by focusing on curbing its oil sales to China as part of ongoing US-China trade negotiations in Stockholm. This move aims to reduce Moscow’s revenue ahead of an August 8 deadline set by President Donald Trump for Russia to cease hostilities in Ukraine. Washington considers Russian oil exports to China critical to sustaining Russia’s economy during the conflict. However, Chinese officials have resisted reducing their oil imports from Russia, prompting US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent to propose a potential 100 percent tariff on Chinese goods.</p>
<p>China’s Foreign Ministry reaffirmed its commitment to securing its energy supplies in line with national interests, rejecting coercion attempts. Analysts suggest Beijing might modestly reduce Russian oil purchases as a goodwill gesture while negotiations continue, possibly paving the way for a Trump-Xi Jinping summit in October. The US is also pressuring China to halt oil imports from Iran, another sanctioned oil exporter. Meanwhile, Washington is increasing tariffs on India over its Russian oil purchases, signaling a broader strategy to isolate Moscow economically. China’s leverage includes its dominance in rare earth mineral exports, which are vital for US technology and defense industries, complicating US efforts to pressure Beijing.</p>

<p>In Cedar Rapids, Iowa, multiple immigrants were detained during mandatory check-in appointments at the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) office on Tuesday morning, despite a large rally of hundreds supporting the immigrants outside. The community rally, organized by nonprofit Escucha Mi Voz, involved elected officials accompanying immigrants to their appointments to reduce the risk of detentions. Five individuals were accompanied and left without incident, with their next appointments scheduled for a year later.</p>
<p>However, three individuals were detained, including Hugo Zamora from Postville and Moctar Sanogo from Muscatine. Sanogo’s wife, a U.S. citizen, expressed concern over his detention, as he had been preparing for voluntary departure to avoid deportation. The detentions occurred without public explanation from ICE officials. Protesters from the Justice and Liberation Coalition briefly blocked ICE vehicles, leading to police intervention but no arrests. The events followed recent protests supporting Pascual Pedro, a young immigrant deported in July despite no criminal record, highlighting ongoing tensions over immigration enforcement in the region.</p>

<div class="h2-section-wrapper"><h2>Brooke Hogan Explains Her Exit from Hulk Hogan’s Will Amid Family Disputes</h2><div class="source-indicator-container"><div class="source-item" data-href="https://wlap.iheart.com/content/2025-08-05-brooke-hogan-reveals-why-she-took-herself-out-of-hulks-will/"><img class="source-favicon" src="https://www.google.com/s2/favicons?domain=wlap.iheart.com" alt="Favicon for wlap.iheart.com"></div></div></div>
<p>Brooke Hogan, daughter of the late WWE Hall of Famer Hulk Hogan, revealed in an interview why she removed herself from her father’s will in 2023. Pregnant with twins and newly married, Brooke cited concerns about potential financial conflicts involving her mother, Linda, and Hulk Hogan’s third wife, Sky Daily. She expressed apprehension about becoming entangled in disputes connected to Scientology influences and feared for the wellbeing of loved ones. Brooke emphasized that her decision was not due to any personal issues with Daily, who she described as kind, but because she did not want to engage in contentious battles.</p>
<p>Brooke’s husband, Steven Olesky, detailed a strained relationship between Brooke and her father, noting that the breakdown followed a series of difficult phone calls. Hulk Hogan reportedly skipped Brooke’s 2022 wedding and later married Daily, an event Brooke also missed. Olesky stressed that the rift was related to Hulk Hogan’s treatment of Brooke rather than his wife. Brooke also endured emotional hardship due to past incidents involving her father, including leaked audio of him using racial slurs. Hulk Hogan’s death in July was officially attributed to a heart attack, with underlying health conditions including atrial fibrillation and chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Hogan was a prominent figure in professional wrestling, inducted twice into the WWE Hall of Fame.</p>

<div class="h2-section-wrapper"><h2>Illinois State University Remembers Influential Dean Ralph Linkins on Anniversary of Death</h2><div class="source-indicator-container"><div class="source-item" data-href="https://news.illinoisstate.edu/2025/08/this-month-in-illinois-state-university-history-august-2/"><img class="source-favicon" src="https://www.google.com/s2/favicons?domain=news.illinoisstate.edu" alt="Favicon for news.illinoisstate.edu"></div></div></div>
<p>Illinois State University commemorated the legacy of Dr. Ralph Linkins, a beloved dean of men who passed away on August 5, 1968. Linkins served the university for over two decades, known for his mentorship, promotion of cultural activities, and advocacy for gentlemanly conduct among students. Born in 1887, he joined Illinois State as a zoology instructor before becoming dean of men in 1930, dedicating himself fully to student counseling from 1931 onward.</p>
<p>Linkins was instrumental in fostering campus culture through events, dances, and the establishment of Smith Hall residence. He was recognized for his firm yet caring approach to student discipline and support. The university honors his contributions through awards and facilities bearing his name. Linkins’ commitment to education and student welfare left a lasting impact on Illinois State’s community and traditions.</p>

<div class="h2-section-wrapper"><h2>NFL Team Names Reflect Rich Histories and Local Legacies</h2><div class="source-indicator-container"><div class="source-item" data-href="https://www.orovillemr.com/2025/08/05/the-story-behind-every-nfl-team-name/"><img class="source-favicon" src="https://www.google.com/s2/favicons?domain=www.orovillemr.com" alt="Favicon for www.orovillemr.com"></div></div></div>
<p>An exploration of the origins of all 32 National Football League (NFL) team names reveals diverse inspirations ranging from local culture, historical figures, and fan input. For example, the Arizona Cardinals have maintained their name since 1920, originating from the color of used jerseys. The Baltimore Ravens’ name pays homage to Edgar Allan Poe, a Baltimore resident. Teams such as the Minnesota Vikings reflect regional heritage, while the Tampa Bay Buccaneers draw on Florida’s pirate history.</p>
<p>Several teams underwent rebranding due to relocation or social considerations, such as the Washington Commanders, formerly the Redskins, who changed their name in 2022 amid controversy. The Dallas Cowboys’ nickname emerged to avoid confusion with a baseball team, and the New York Jets adopted their modern name in 1963 following a fan contest. These names often carry significant meaning for local fans and embody the identity and history of their cities and regions.</p>

<div class="h2-section-wrapper"><h2>NSW Police and Public Debate Safety Measures Following Bridge March</h2><div class="source-indicator-container"><div class="source-item" data-href="https://www.smh.com.au/national/nsw/police-just-can-t-win-when-it-comes-to-public-safety-20250805-p5mkeq.html"><img class="source-favicon" src="https://www.google.com/s2/favicons?domain=www.smh.com.au" alt="Favicon for www.smh.com.au"></div></div></div>
<p>In New South Wales, Australia, public discourse continues regarding the police response to a recent large-scale bridge march. While the event proceeded peacefully, some participants criticized the police for turning marchers back and for the handling of crowd dispersal, which led to long queues at public transport points. Police and emergency services defended their actions as necessary for safety reasons, especially given the unexpectedly large turnout.</p>
<p>Letters to local newspapers reflect contrasting views. Some commend the police and organizers for managing the event without injuries, while others call for improved communication and planning for future marches. The incident has also sparked debate on political leadership and the balance between public safety and the right to protest. Calls for broader awareness of other humanitarian crises, such as the famine in Sudan, have also emerged in the public conversation.</p>
