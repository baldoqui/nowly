<p>El Paso County, Texas, has experienced a record number of heat-related deaths in 2024, with 39 fatalities directly or indirectly attributed to extreme heat, surpassing the previous record of 26 in 2023. This surge coincides with El Paso being one of the fastest-warming U.S. cities, where average annual temperatures have risen by 5.7 degrees Fahrenheit since 1970. Vulnerable groups include migrants crossing the U.S.-Mexico border, elderly residents, and hikers in local mountainous areas.</p>
<p>Despite the alarming statistics, neither the city nor county of El Paso publicly shares detailed data on heat-related illnesses or investigations into these deaths. The city relies on an unfunded volunteer task force for heat mitigation, lacking dedicated staff or sufficient public health resources. Local humanitarian organizations urge officials to improve data collection and implement evidence-based strategies to prevent further fatalities. The heat crisis is exacerbated by climate change, with projections indicating a near doubling of 100-degree days in Texas by 2036.</p>

<div class="h2-section-wrapper"><h2>Travis County Flood Response Faces Scrutiny Over Delayed Search and Rescue Efforts</h2><div class="source-indicator-container"><div class="source-item" data-href="https://www.statesman.com/news/local/article/texas-flood-travis-county-response-big-sandy-creek-20817985.php"><img class="source-favicon" src="https://www.google.com/s2/favicons?domain=www.statesman.com" alt="Favicon for www.statesman.com"></div></div></div>
<p>Following devastating floods on July 5 near Big Sandy Creek in Travis County, Texas, local officials faced criticism over the perceived delay in requesting and managing large-scale search-and-rescue operations. Residents reported feeling abandoned, with some recovering bodies themselves due to limited visible presence and communication from county authorities. Travis County Judge Andy Brown acknowledged communication shortcomings and pledged improvements.</p>
<p>Initially, local emergency services responded to approximately 200 calls and conducted numerous rescues despite challenging conditions. However, it took nearly 60 hours before the county requested state management of the response, which brought in about 560 personnel, including specialized search teams and canine units. The search for missing persons continued until July 23, with ten confirmed fatalities in the county.</p>
<p>Experts note that decisions on scaling search efforts involve complex judgments balancing resource management and operational effectiveness. The incident highlights the challenges of coordinating disaster response over large, difficult terrains and the importance of clear communication with affected communities.</p>

<div class="h2-section-wrapper"><h2>Trump-Putin Alaska Summit Yields No Ceasefire, Raises Questions for Ukraine Peace Talks</h2><div class="source-indicator-container"><div class="source-item" data-href="https://indianexpress.com/article/upsc-current-affairs/upsc-key-alaska-summit-gst-reforms-nisar-western-ghats-10194677/"><img class="source-favicon" src="https://www.google.com/s2/favicons?domain=indianexpress.com" alt="Favicon for indianexpress.com"></div></div></div>
<p>The high-profile summit between U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska ended without agreement on a ceasefire in Ukraine, despite Trump’s initial push for one. Putin reportedly demanded that Ukraine cede all of Donetsk, a key industrial region, as part of any peace deal. Trump indicated he agreed with Putin on seeking a peace settlement without a prior ceasefire, a stance rejected by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who is scheduled to meet Trump in Washington.</p>
<p>European leaders, including Germany’s Chancellor Friedrich Merz and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, are joining Zelenskyy in Washington to support Ukraine and discuss security guarantees amid ongoing conflict. The summit underscored deep divisions over territorial concessions and the future of the war, with Western allies reaffirming support for Ukraine’s sovereignty.</p>
<p>The outcome leaves uncertainty over the trajectory of peace negotiations and potential impacts on geopolitical relations, including U.S.-India trade tensions linked to sanctions over India’s purchase of Russian oil.</p>

<p>Palantir Technologies, a leading data analytics and artificial intelligence company, marked its fifth year since relocating its headquarters from Silicon Valley to Denver, Colorado. With a current valuation of $437.2 billion and over $1 billion in quarterly revenue, Palantir is the most valuable company based in the state. The firm provides AI-driven solutions for clients ranging from airlines to the U.S. military and Ukrainian forces.</p>
<p>Despite its commercial success, Palantir faces ongoing scrutiny and protests over its contracts with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), its involvement in military operations, and alleged data aggregation on Americans. Former employees and human rights organizations have criticized the company’s role in surveillance and immigration enforcement. Palantir’s CEO Alexander Karp emphasizes the company’s commitment to supporting Western liberal democracies and fighting terrorism.</p>
<p>The company’s presence has sparked debate within Colorado about the ethical implications of its work, even as it contributes to the state’s growing tech ecosystem.</p>

<p>The Tapanuli orangutan, the world’s newest great ape species with fewer than 800 individuals, faces an existential threat from the construction of the Batang Toru hydroelectric dam in North Sumatra, Indonesia. The dam, financed and built by Chinese state-owned enterprises, is situated in the heart of the orangutan’s fragmented habitat, risking isolation of subpopulations and habitat loss.</p>
<p>Environmentalists and scientists have campaigned against the dam, highlighting its potential to drive the species toward extinction. Opposition has met with intimidation and violence, including the suspicious death of a local environmental lawyer. Despite temporary withdrawal of financing by Bank of China, the project continues under new Chinese ownership.</p>
<p>The dam’s construction has disrupted local ecosystems and communities, with limited transparency on mitigation efforts. Conservationists call for coordinated action among stakeholders to protect the orangutans and preserve the biodiversity of the Batang Toru ecosystem.</p>

<p>Israel witnessed a one-day nationwide strike and widespread protests organized by families of hostages and bereaved relatives, demanding a ceasefire and the safe return of hostages held by Hamas. Demonstrators blocked roads, closed businesses, and gathered at political and military sites, facing police water cannon dispersals and dozens of arrests.</p>
<p>Protesters voiced concerns that ongoing military operations threaten the lives of hostages taken during the Hamas attack in October 2023. The government, led by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, maintains a hardline stance, opposing any deal that leaves Hamas in power and emphasizing the need to defeat the militant group.</p>
<p>The protests reflect growing public frustration over the conflict’s toll and the perceived lack of progress in securing hostages’ release. Meanwhile, humanitarian conditions in Gaza continue to deteriorate amid ongoing Israeli military actions and blockades.</p>

<p>Pakistani esports players have achieved notable international success, particularly in Tekken and PUBG Mobile competitions, despite limited domestic infrastructure and support. The country’s Tekken team won the Nations Cup in Seoul, and the PUBG Mobile team qualified for the Esports World Cup, finishing sixth among 24 teams.</p>
<p>Players often train in informal settings such as gaming cafés with inconsistent internet and equipment, lacking access to professional academies or regular competitive leagues. Financial constraints, visa difficulties, and absence of government recognition further challenge their progress. The Ministry of Information Technology and Telecommunication is drafting a National Esports Policy aimed at formalizing the sector with a federation, training programs, and digital arenas.</p>
<p>Experts emphasize the need for a coordinated approach involving both technology and sports authorities to build sustainable pathways for talent development. The resilience and achievements of Pakistani players highlight potential for growth if systemic support is provided.</p>

<p>The rapid expansion of artificial intelligence has triggered a surge in data center construction across the United States, with tech giants investing billions in facilities that consume vast amounts of electricity and water. AI data centers require significantly more energy than traditional data centers, with some projects demanding gigawatts of power comparable to small cities.</p>
<p>The Trump administration’s AI Action Plan promotes streamlined permitting and regulatory rollbacks to accelerate data center development, raising concerns about strain on electric grids, water resources, and local communities. Residents near proposed data centers have expressed fears over water depletion, environmental degradation, and limited economic benefits relative to costs.</p>
<p>Companies like Meta and Google pledge sustainability goals, including renewable energy use and water recycling, but experts question the feasibility of meeting climate targets amid rapid growth. The industry’s expansion highlights the tension between technological advancement and environmental stewardship.</p>

<p>Washington State’s plan to replace its diesel-powered ferry fleet with hybrid-electric vessels by 2040 has raised complex issues regarding the disposal of retired ferries. Several decommissioned ferries remain abandoned or beached, posing environmental hazards due to corroded materials and toxic substances like polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs).</p>
<p>Efforts to sell old ferries internationally have encountered legal and ethical challenges, including compliance with the U.S. Toxic Substances Control Act and the Basel Convention on hazardous waste. A recent sale to an Ecuadorian company was halted amid concerns over environmental risks and labor conditions.</p>
<p>The lack of regional shipbreaking facilities on the U.S. West Coast complicates responsible dismantling, with transportation costs and regulatory barriers limiting options. State officials emphasize the need for sustainable disposal methods to prevent further environmental damage and legal liabilities.</p>

European leaders, including France’s Emmanuel Macron and the EU’s Ursula von der Leyen, will also attend, signaling strong support for Ukraine.</p>
<p>A recent poll shows that 68% of Germans expect the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party to hold one or more state premier positions by 2026, reflecting shifting political dynamics.
