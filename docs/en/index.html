<p>Israeli occupation forces continued a series of aggressive operations against Palestinian civilians across Jerusalem and various parts of the West Bank on Tuesday. Dozens of Israeli paramilitary settlers stormed the Al-Aqsa Mosque compound, the third holiest site in Islam, conducting provocative tours and performing Talmudic rituals under Israeli military protection. Concurrently, demolition and displacement orders were handed to families in Jabal al-Baba, east of Jerusalem, exacerbating fears of forced evictions.</p>
<p>In Bethlehem, Israeli forces assaulted a young man in Al-Khader town and ransacked a family home, resulting in injuries requiring hospital treatment. Multiple raids and tear gas deployments were reported in Nablus city and its surrounding refugee camps and villages, with no arrests recorded. Similar military incursions occurred in Qalqilia, Ramallah, Hebron, and Tulkarem areas, including abductions and property destruction.</p>
<p>The ongoing campaign has severely impacted Palestinian agriculture, with over 8,200 farmers suffering $76 million in damages since October 2023 due to crop destruction, theft, and resource targeting. The destruction of the only Palestinian seed bank on July 31 threatens future harvests and regional food security.</p>
<p>Protests in Nablus condemned the escalating violence and called for support for prisoners facing torture. The Palestinian Journalists Syndicate highlighted the killing of at least 238 journalists since the conflict began, emphasizing ongoing efforts to document and prosecute war crimes.</p>
<p>These developments occur amid a broader Israeli military campaign in Gaza, where over 61,599 Palestinians have been killed since October 2023, including a recent surge linked to malnutrition and restricted humanitarian aid.</p>

<p>US President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin are scheduled to meet in Anchorage, Alaska, in a summit framed as a "listening exercise" by the White House. The meeting aims to gain a better understanding of how to potentially end the protracted war in Ukraine. However, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky will not attend, expressing concerns over proposals that could force Ukraine to cede territory, particularly in the Donetsk region.</p>
<p>Russia demands that Ukraine withdraw from several occupied regions and recognize Crimea and other annexed territories as Russian. Zelensky insists that any territorial discussions must follow a full ceasefire and security guarantees, rejecting neutrality clauses and demands to abandon NATO aspirations.</p>
<p>European leaders, including German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, are set to hold virtual talks with Trump and Zelensky ahead of the summit, emphasizing that Ukraine must be central to any peace negotiations. They warn against sidelining Ukraine in discussions between the US and Russia.</p>
<p>On the battlefield, Russian forces have launched offensives in eastern Ukraine, making tactical advances near Dobropillia and increasing missile and drone attacks across Ukrainian territory. Ukrainian intelligence reports North Korean troop deployments to Russia, supporting Moscow's war efforts.</p>
<p>The summit reflects deep geopolitical complexities, with the US reducing military aid to Ukraine and advocating for territorial compromises, while Europe seeks to maintain a firm stance supporting Ukrainian sovereignty.</p>

<p>In a Major League Baseball game at Angel Stadium on August 12, 2025, the Los Angeles Angels secured a 7-6 walk-off victory over the Los Angeles Dodgers in the 10th inning. Jo Adell delivered the game-winning RBI single, extending the Angels’ perfect 5-0 record against the Dodgers this season. The Angels also executed a rare triple play against Dodgers star Shohei Ohtani during the sixth inning, despite Ohtani hitting a go-ahead solo home run in the top of the ninth.</p>
<p>The Dodgers’ loss marked their third consecutive defeat, causing them to lose their sole lead in the National League West division to the San Diego Padres. The Dodgers have struggled in close games recently, with a record of 10-13 in their last 23 games and eight losses in their past 11 one-run contests.</p>
<p>The Angels, although on the fringes of the American League postseason race with a 58-62 record, have demonstrated an uncanny ability to perform against the Dodgers, extending their winning streak in the Freeway Series to six games — their longest since 2003-2004.</p>
<p>Dodgers manager Dave Roberts acknowledged the need for improvement across all areas, while Angels interim manager Ray Montgomery praised his team’s resilience and collective effort in a high-pressure game.</p>

<div class="h2-section-wrapper"><h2>IGAD Continues Mediation Efforts Amid Sudan Conflict, Faces Challenges</h2><div class="source-indicator-container"><div class="source-item" data-href="https://worldpolicyhub.com/igads-role-in-conflict-resolution-from-regional-security-structures-to-the-sudan-crisis/"><img class="source-favicon" src="https://www.google.com/s2/favicons?domain=worldpolicyhub.com" alt="Favicon for worldpolicyhub.com"></div></div></div>
<p>The Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD) has been actively engaged in mediating the armed conflict in Sudan, which erupted in April 2023 between the Sudanese Armed Forces led by Abdel Fattah al-Burhan and the Rapid Support Forces commanded by Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo (Hemedti). IGAD convened several extraordinary summits and established a Quartet mediation committee comprising leaders from Djibouti, Kenya, South Sudan, and Ethiopia to facilitate dialogue.</p>
<p>Key initiatives include urging an immediate ceasefire, establishing humanitarian corridors, and initiating comprehensive political negotiations. Despite these efforts, Sudan’s government has expressed reservations about IGAD’s mediation, particularly opposing Kenya’s chairmanship of the Quartet due to perceived partiality toward the Rapid Support Forces. The government also rejected proposals for deploying regional peacekeeping forces, citing sovereignty concerns.</p>
<p>IGAD has faced challenges such as fragmented mediation platforms, lack of political will among member states, and limited enforcement capabilities. The multiplicity of peace initiatives has allowed conflicting agendas, with Sudan engaging selectively and sometimes rejecting international mediation efforts. The complex regional dynamics and competing interests among IGAD countries further complicate the peace process.</p>
<p>IGAD continues to coordinate with the African Union and the United Nations to unify mediation efforts and has appointed a special envoy to Sudan to enhance coordination. However, the conflict persists with ongoing hostilities and a deteriorating humanitarian situation.</p>

<p>Poland’s Baltic coast and southern mountain regions have seen a significant increase in tourists from the Czech Republic and Gulf countries seeking alternatives to traditional summer destinations. The Czech Republic has shifted travel patterns, with a growing number of tourists favoring Poland’s Baltic coast, facilitated by new direct train services such as the Baltic Express connecting Prague to Gdynia, Sopot, and Gdansk. Czech tourists now represent the fourth largest foreign tourist group in Poland, with projections for 2025 suggesting up to 800,000 visitors, surpassing Czech arrivals in Croatia.</p>
<p>Zakopane, located in Poland’s Tatra Mountains, has become a favored alpine retreat for Gulf tourists escaping summer heat. The resort town attracts thousands from the UAE, Saudi Arabia, and Kuwait, supported by multiple daily flights to Krakow and tailored hospitality services including halal menus and Arabic-language materials. Local businesses and authorities have adapted to accommodate the influx, promoting safety and cultural inclusivity.</p>
<p>While Poland offers a cooler climate and unique cultural experiences compared to Mediterranean destinations, visitors are advised to prepare for variable weather conditions. The rise in tourism reflects broader economic growth in Poland and evolving preferences among international travelers.</p>

<p>The United Kingdom’s Royal Navy flagship, HMS Prince of Wales, participated in a major nine-day multinational military exercise in the northern Philippine Sea alongside naval forces from the United States, Japan, Australia, Spain, and Norway. The drills focused on anti-submarine warfare, flying operations, and interoperability, including historic events such as a British F-35B Lightning jet landing on the Japanese helicopter carrier JS Kaga.</p>
<p>Defence Secretary John Healey emphasized the UK's readiness to support allies in the Indo-Pacific region, highlighting the importance of joint exercises in deterring aggression, particularly amid rising tensions with China over Taiwan. The exercises involved 11 warships and 23 aircraft, showcasing advanced capabilities including supersonic F-35B stealth jets engaging in mock dogfights.</p>
<p>The deployment is part of Operation Highmast, with planned port visits in Tokyo and Busan before the strike group returns to the UK. The show of force underscores NATO and allied commitment to security in the Indo-Pacific amid concerns over potential Chinese military actions.</p>
