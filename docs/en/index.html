<p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu declared an escalation in the 22-month conflict with Hamas by announcing plans to take control of Gaza City. The city has already suffered extensive destruction from previous bombardments and incursions. The planned ground operation is expected to cause further mass displacement and exacerbate the already dire humanitarian crisis in the Gaza Strip.</p>
<p>Palestinians in Gaza City expressed resignation and defiance, with many stating they have no intention to leave their homes despite the devastation. Israeli citizens showed mixed reactions, with some fearing for the safety of Israeli hostages held in Gaza, while others supported the military action against Hamas. The operation will likely require mobilizing thousands of troops and forcibly evacuating civilians. Netanyahu indicated intentions to eventually take control of the entire Gaza Strip and transfer authority to a friendly Arab civilian administration.</p>
<p>International responses included condemnation from countries such as France, Iran, Saudi Arabia, Pakistan, and criticism from the UK, Spain, Turkey, Australia, and Germany. The United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres warned that the military operation risks deepening the humanitarian catastrophe and endangering more lives, including hostages. Germany announced a suspension of military exports that could be used in Gaza until further notice.</p>
<p>Mediators from Egypt and Qatar are reportedly working on a framework for a ceasefire that would include the release of all hostages and Israeli withdrawal from Gaza. The United Nations Security Council has scheduled an emergency meeting to discuss Israel’s plans. Meanwhile, aid delivery to Gaza remains severely constrained, with the European Union reporting that despite some shipments, most humanitarian aid is looted upon arrival.</p>

<p>Between August 6 and August 8, 2025, Israeli military operations in Gaza resulted in at least 172 Palestinian deaths and over 900 injuries. The Gaza Strip continues to endure relentless airstrikes, missile launches, and gunfire targeting homes, medical facilities, and other infrastructure. The cumulative death toll in Gaza since October 7, 2023, has surpassed 61,300, with over 152,000 wounded. Approximately 70% of those killed are women and children, according to United Nations reports.</p>
<p>The agricultural capacity in Gaza has been devastated, with 86% of cropland damaged or inaccessible, contributing to widespread starvation and malnutrition. The World Health Organization has facilitated medical evacuations, but thousands remain in urgent need of treatment. The healthcare system is overwhelmed by mass casualties and disease outbreaks.</p>
<p>In the West Bank, Israeli forces have conducted numerous raids, home invasions, and military operations resulting in multiple injuries and arrests. Israeli settlers have perpetrated attacks, property damage, and forced displacements across various communities. The ongoing violence has led to widespread fear, displacement, and disruption of daily life for Palestinians.</p>

<p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy firmly rejected proposals suggesting Ukraine might relinquish territory to Russia as part of a peace deal. His statement came after U.S. President Donald Trump indicated that a potential agreement with Russia could involve "some swapping of territories." Zelenskyy emphasized that any decisions made without Ukraine’s involvement are invalid and undermine peace efforts.</p>
<p>The Trump-Putin summit is scheduled for August 15, 2025, in Alaska, marking a significant diplomatic event in the ongoing conflict that began with Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in 2022. Ukrainian and European officials convened in England on August 10, 2025, to coordinate their support for Ukraine and discuss peace prospects.</p>
<p>Public opinion in Kyiv reflects skepticism and concern over territorial concessions, with many citizens unwilling to compromise despite the ongoing human toll. Zelenskyy reiterated that Ukraine’s territorial integrity, enshrined in its constitution, is nonnegotiable, though some officials privately acknowledge the possibility of accepting a peace deal that recognizes the current military realities.</p>
<p>The Kremlin continues its military campaign, with recent drone attacks causing casualties in Ukrainian cities such as Kherson and Zaporizhzhia. Russia claims to have intercepted numerous Ukrainian drones over its territory and the Black Sea.</p>

<div class="h2-section-wrapper"><h2>U.S.-Russia-China Power Dynamics Shape Global Geopolitical Landscape</h2><div class="source-indicator-container"><div class="source-item" data-href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14986097/Winning-race-global-domination-Experts-explain.html"><img class="source-favicon" src="https://www.google.com/s2/favicons?domain=www.dailymail.co.uk" alt="Favicon for www.dailymail.co.uk"></div></div></div>
<p>Experts highlight a tri-polar global power structure dominated by the United States, Russia, and China, each exerting influence through different means. The United States maintains military strength and soft power through cultural exports, though its global dominance is challenged by rising isolationism and shifting alliances. China leverages economic influence via initiatives like the Belt and Road, expanding its reach in Asia, Africa, and South America, while preparing for potential territorial claims such as Taiwan. Russia relies heavily on military power and strategic interventions, including its ongoing conflict in Ukraine and mercenary activities in various regions.</p>
<p>The geopolitical contest among these superpowers is shaping the future of international relations, with significant implications for regional stability and global security. The upcoming Trump-Putin summit in Alaska is viewed as a critical moment within this broader context.</p>
