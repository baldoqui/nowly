<p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has publicly defended a new, broader military offensive in Gaza, stating Israel “has no choice but to finish the job and complete the defeat of Hamas.” The offensive, more extensive than previously announced, targets Hamas strongholds not only in Gaza City but also in the “central camps” of Muwasi. Netanyahu emphasized that Israel’s goal is to “free Gaza,” not to occupy it, and rejected accusations of starvation policies in the territory, acknowledging only a shortage and denying deliberate starvation.</p>
<p>Netanyahu criticized Germany’s Chancellor Friedrich Merz for halting exports of military equipment to Israel that could be used in Gaza, accusing him of succumbing to international pressure. He also announced plans to increase aid distribution sites in Gaza and directed the Israeli military to allow more foreign journalists into the territory, a significant shift from the previous embeds-only policy. Netanyahu blamed Hamas for civilian deaths, destruction, and aid shortages, describing the group as having “thousands of armed terrorists” and asserting that Palestinians are “begging” to be freed from them.</p>
<p>The United States defended Israel’s right to self-defense during a United Nations Security Council meeting, dismissing genocide allegations as false. However, other members, including China and Russia, expressed deep concern over the humanitarian situation, with the UN humanitarian office describing conditions in Gaza as “beyond horrific” and equating the crisis to starvation. Reports indicated at least 31 Palestinians were killed while seeking aid, with witnesses accusing Israeli forces of firing on crowds near aid distribution points. The hunger toll among Palestinian children has reached 100 since the conflict began. Meanwhile, hostages’ relatives in Israel have called for a labor strike over the planned offensive, fearing for the safety of those held captive by Hamas.</p>

<p>U.S. President Donald Trump is scheduled to meet Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska in a highly anticipated summit aimed at addressing the ongoing war in Ukraine. This will be the first time Putin has been invited to the U.S. outside the United Nations since 2007. The meeting, requested by Putin, is viewed as a test of Russia’s willingness to negotiate seriously on ending the conflict.</p>
<p>Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and European leaders have insisted that any peace deal must include Kyiv and the European Union, emphasizing that Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity cannot be compromised. European Union foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas and NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte underscored the necessity of Ukraine’s involvement in negotiations and insisted that a ceasefire must precede any territorial discussions. NATO has committed to continuing military aid to Ukraine regardless of the summit’s outcome.</p>
<p>Trump indicated that the proposed peace deal could involve “some swapping of territories” between Russia and Ukraine, a suggestion strongly rejected by Ukraine, which considers ceding territory unconstitutional. Western officials remain cautious, warning against premature concessions that could embolden Russia or undermine Ukraine’s position. U.S. Vice President JD Vance has been coordinating with European and Ukrainian officials to align strategies ahead of the summit.</p>
<p>Russian demands include Ukraine’s neutral status, recognition of Russian annexations, and limits on its military, while Ukraine seeks a full ceasefire, security guarantees, and rejection of Russian territorial claims. Analysts predict the summit may not produce an immediate peace agreement but could initiate a new phase of diplomatic engagement.</p>

<p>Ahead of the Alaska summit, European nations including France, Germany, Italy, Poland, Finland, and the United Kingdom have issued a joint statement reaffirming their support for Ukraine. They emphasized that peace negotiations must involve Ukraine directly and that any resolution must respect Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity. The statement called for a ceasefire or reduction in hostilities as a prerequisite for meaningful negotiations and pledged continued military and financial support to Kyiv.</p>
<p>Ukrainian President Zelenskyy expressed gratitude for the support, reiterating that Ukraine will not cede any territory to Russia. European leaders warned against allowing Russia to use negotiations as a pretext to consolidate territorial gains or undermine the transatlantic alliance. French President Emmanuel Macron and UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer have engaged in dialogue with Zelenskyy and other Western allies to coordinate approaches.</p>
<p>Concerns persist that the summit could sideline Ukraine or pressure it into unfavorable concessions. NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte praised the U.S. for increasing military aid to Ukraine and imposing secondary sanctions on countries supporting Russia’s war effort, underscoring the alliance’s unity against Russian aggression.</p>

<div class="h2-section-wrapper"><h2>Historic Peace Agreement Signed Between Armenia and Azerbaijan in Washington</h2><div class="source-indicator-container"><div class="source-item" data-href="https://dnd.com.pk/wars-are-not-options-but-the-trade-is/327159/"><img class="source-favicon" src="https://www.google.com/s2/favicons?domain=dnd.com.pk" alt="Favicon for dnd.com.pk"></div></div></div>
<p>In a significant diplomatic breakthrough, U.S. President Donald Trump hosted a summit in Washington, D.C., where Azerbaijan’s President Ilham Aliyev and Armenia’s Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan signed a Memorandum of Understanding establishing a Strategic Working Group to develop a Charter on Strategic Partnership between the two countries and the United States. This agreement marks a decisive step toward normalizing relations following decades of conflict over the Nagorno-Karabakh region.</p>
<p>The agreement includes plans for the “Trump Route for International Peace and Prosperity” (TRIPP), a connectivity project through Armenian territory that will link the Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic to the rest of Azerbaijan without checkpoints, facilitating trade and transit between Europe, Azerbaijan, and Central Asia. The deal also calls for the closure of the OSCE Minsk Process and related structures, signaling an end to previous conflict resolution frameworks.</p>
<p>The peace deal is hailed as a historic achievement for regional stability and economic development. It reflects the leadership of President Aliyev and the diplomatic efforts of President Trump in brokering a peaceful resolution. Both Armenian and Azerbaijani leaders committed to maintaining good neighborly relations based on respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity, rejecting revenge and violence.</p>

<p>Initiatives under the strategy aim to diversify cultural sites, theme parks, retail offerings, and events, including year-round concerts and festivals.

<p>Hundreds of demonstrators, including family members of Israeli hostages taken by Hamas on October 7, marched to Downing Street in London to demand the release of the remaining hostages. The “National March for the Hostages,” organized by Stop the Hate UK and Jewish organizations, saw several confrontations with counter-protesters and resulted in three arrests.</p>
<p>Protesters urged the UK government to prioritize the hostages’ release before recognizing a Palestinian state, a move pledged by Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer contingent on certain conditions being met by the Israeli government. Speakers included relatives of hostages and the UK’s Chief Rabbi Sir Ephraim Mirvis, who criticized the prospect of recognizing a Palestinian state led by a terrorist organization while hostages remain captive.</p>
<p>The march witnessed tensions as some speakers from progressive Judaism advocating Palestinian self-determination were booed. The demonstration reflects growing divisions within the UK over the Israeli-Palestinian conflict amid Israel’s military operations in Gaza City, which have drawn international criticism and calls for ceasefire and humanitarian access.</p>

<div class="h2-section-wrapper"><h2>U.S. Immigration Enforcement Intensifies with Alexandria, Louisiana as Major Deportation Hub</h2><div class="source-indicator-container"><div class="source-item" data-href="http://eturbonews.com/ice-tourism-to-hell-in-alexandria-louisiana-usa/"><img class="source-favicon" src="https://www.google.com/s2/favicons?domain=eturbonews.com" alt="Favicon for eturbonews.com"></div></div></div>
<p>Alexandria, Louisiana has emerged as the most active deportation hub in the United States under the Trump administration’s escalated immigration enforcement policies. Since January, over 21,000 individuals have been processed through the Alexandria Staging Facility, a 400-bed detention center located on the airport grounds, which functions as the logistical heart of the deportation network.</p>
<p>The facility coordinates an extensive network of detention centers in Louisiana, many operated by private companies, which are overcrowded and have been criticized for inhumane conditions. Over 40,000 people have passed through this deportation system in just seven months, with more than 1,300 flights processed for transfers and deportations.</p>
<p>The expansion of detention and deportation operations has had significant economic impacts on local communities, with some towns relying heavily on ICE contracts for income. Despite growing criticism and resistance, the Trump administration plans to expand this model nationwide, including new large-scale tent detention centers in Florida and Texas.</p>

<div class="h2-section-wrapper"><h2>Controversy Over Canadian Arms Exports to Israel Amid Gaza Conflict</h2><div class="source-indicator-container"><div class="source-item" data-href="https://niagarafallsreview.ca/news/canada/the-controversy-over-canadas-rules-on-military-exports-to-israel-explained/article_8307d461-359c-56df-999f-b8bfd5dae25d.html"><img class="source-favicon" src="https://www.google.com/s2/favicons?domain=niagarafallsreview.ca" alt="Favicon for niagarafallsreview.ca"></div></div></div>
<p>Canadian arms exports to Israel have come under scrutiny following reports that components and equipment potentially used in the Gaza conflict have been shipped from Canada. While the Canadian government maintains it has suspended permits for lethal weapons exports to Israel since January 2024 and only allows exports of non-lethal equipment, critics argue that many components, such as circuit boards and parts for detection systems, contribute to Israel’s military capabilities.</p>
<p>Activists and some Canadian senators have called for greater transparency and a thorough investigation into what military goods are reaching Israel, especially amid allegations of human rights violations in Gaza. The government asserts that some exports support defensive systems like the Iron Dome and that restrictions exclude lethal weaponry.</p>
<p>The controversy has sparked public debate in Canada regarding the ethical implications of arms exports amid the ongoing conflict, with a majority of Canadians surveyed favoring restrictions on military exports to Israel.</p>
