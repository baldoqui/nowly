<p>US President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin met at Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson in Anchorage, Alaska, marking their first face-to-face encounter since Trump’s return to the White House and the first meeting in over seven years. The summit aims to explore possible common ground that could lead to a ceasefire in the ongoing war in Ukraine.</p>
<p>The talks included one-on-one discussions, delegation-level meetings, and a joint press conference. While expectations for substantive agreements remain low, potential outcomes include symbolic commitments to continue negotiations, humanitarian measures such as prisoner exchanges, or a loosely worded framework for a ceasefire. Any agreement legitimizing Russia’s territorial gains would face strong opposition from Kyiv and European capitals.</p>
<p>Putin seeks recognition of Russian control over territories seized in eastern and southern Ukraine, demands that Kyiv abandon NATO membership ambitions, and wants a pro-Moscow government installed in Ukraine. Trump described the meeting as a "feel-out" session, aiming to assess if a deal is possible, and suggested both leaders desire peace. However, Kyiv’s absence from the talks and European concerns about potential "land swaps" and reduced US support for Ukraine remain significant issues.</p>
<p>European leaders have engaged in diplomatic efforts to influence the US position, emphasizing Ukraine’s right to decide its future and the need for a ceasefire first. Trump reportedly assured European and Ukrainian leaders that he would not negotiate a division of Ukrainian territory, a stance welcomed by Kyiv and its allies.</p>
<p>The summit also serves as a platform for Russia to demonstrate that Western isolation has failed and to press for economic cooperation with the US. Putin’s delegation includes Russia’s finance minister and the head of the Russian Direct Investment Fund, signaling potential economic proposals.</p>
<p>The Alaska summit is as much about optics and geopolitical positioning as it is about conflict resolution, with both leaders seeking to bolster their international standing. The absence of Ukraine at the table complicates the prospects for implementing any agreements reached.</p>

<p>On India’s 79th Independence Day, Prime Minister Narendra Modi delivered a 103-minute address emphasizing national unity, security, and economic self-reliance. He saluted the armed forces for Operation Sindoor, which targeted terrorist infrastructure in Pakistan following a deadly attack in Pahalgam, and warned that India would no longer tolerate nuclear threats or terrorism.</p>
<p>Modi announced the launch of a High-Power Demography Mission to address demographic changes in border areas, which he described as a threat to national security and social harmony. He also outlined plans to expand India’s defense capabilities, including the Sudarshan Chakra Mission, aimed at developing advanced precision weaponry by 2035.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister highlighted India’s progress in technology and energy sectors, noting the establishment of six semiconductor manufacturing units and a thirtyfold increase in solar energy capacity over 11 years. He announced initiatives for energy independence, including the National Deep Water Exploration Mission and increased nuclear energy capacity.</p>
<p>Economic reforms were a key focus, with Modi detailing simplifications in tax laws, including income tax exemption up to Rs 12 lakh, and the upcoming next-generation GST reforms aimed at reducing tax burdens for common citizens and MSMEs. The Pradhan Mantri Viksit Bharat Rojgar Yojana was launched, providing financial incentives to youth employed in the private sector, targeting the creation of 3.5 crore jobs.</p>
<p>Modi praised the empowerment of women through self-help groups and lauded the achievements of farmers and fishermen, noting record production in multiple agricultural sectors and increased exports. He also stressed the importance of sports development and raised concerns about rising obesity rates.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister reaffirmed India’s commitment to its Constitution, commemorated the 50th anniversary of the Emergency, and called for unity and continued progress toward a developed India by 2047.</p>

<div class="h2-section-wrapper"><h2>UN Reports Escalating Humanitarian Crises in Conflict Zones</h2><div class="source-indicator-container"><div class="source-item" data-href="https://www.globalsecurity.org/military/library/news/2025/08/mil-250814-unbrief01.htm"><img class="source-favicon" src="https://www.google.com/s2/favicons?domain=www.globalsecurity.org" alt="Favicon for www.globalsecurity.org"></div></div></div>
<p>The United Nations Secretary-General’s sixteenth annual Report on Conflict-Related Sexual Violence reveals a 25% increase in cases, with the highest numbers in the Central African Republic, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Haiti, Somalia, and South Sudan. Sixty-three state and non-state parties are credibly suspected of committing sexual violence in armed conflicts.</p>
<p>In Ukraine, intense hostilities continue to cause civilian casualties and displacement, with over 6,000 people evacuated from frontline areas in Donetsk and thousands still trapped in conflict zones. July 2025 saw the highest civilian casualty rates since May 2022, with a 48% increase compared to the same period in 2024.</p>
<p>In Gaza, airstrikes and shelling have intensified, hitting residential areas and shelters, exacerbating an already dire humanitarian situation. With 86% of Gaza under Israeli-militarized zones or displacement orders, aid access remains severely restricted. The World Health Organization facilitated the medical evacuation of 38 patients from Gaza recently. The UN continues to call for a ceasefire, the release of hostages, and unimpeded humanitarian access.</p>
<p>In Syria, humanitarian aid is being delivered to those affected by recent violence in southern governorates, despite ongoing insecurity and attacks on aid convoys. Over 190,000 people have been displaced by recent violence.</p>
<p>In Lebanon, UN peacekeepers report ongoing discovery of unauthorized weapons and tunnels in southern Lebanon amid continued Israeli military activities.</p>
<p>Sudan faces a rapid spread of cholera, especially in Darfur, with thousands affected and treatment centers overwhelmed. Fighting and insecurity hinder humanitarian access in several regions. UNICEF and partners have screened tens of thousands of children for malnutrition.</p>
<p>Myanmar continues to grapple with conflict, flooding, and underfunded humanitarian operations, with nearly 1.3 million people affected by recent earthquakes and ongoing violence.</p>
<p>A tragic shipwreck off Lampedusa, Italy, resulted in at least 35 feared dead or missing migrants, highlighting ongoing migration crises in the Mediterranean.</p>

<div class="h2-section-wrapper"><h2>Surge in Targeted Killings of Journalists Amid Gaza Conflict</h2><div class="source-indicator-container"><div class="source-item" data-href="https://www.counterpunch.org/2025/08/15/the-assassination-of-palestinian-journalists/"><img class="source-favicon" src="https://www.google.com/s2/favicons?domain=www.counterpunch.org" alt="Favicon for www.counterpunch.org"></div></div></div>
<p>International legal scholar Richard Falk and media analysts highlight a disturbing pattern of targeting journalists in conflict zones, particularly in Gaza. The Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) have been accused of systematically attacking journalists, including the recent airstrike that killed six Al Jazeera journalists outside Al-Shifa Hospital. Israel’s posthumous labeling of slain journalists as Hamas operatives is viewed as a tactic to discredit and justify such attacks.</p>
<p>The weaponization of information and suppression of dissenting voices form part of a broader strategy to control narratives and undermine critical reporting. Israeli intelligence reportedly uses advanced surveillance technologies to target influential journalists. Western media’s reluctance to label Israel’s actions as genocide or apartheid contributes to the silencing of Palestinian perspectives.</p>
<p>The killing of journalists in protected zones violates international humanitarian law and exacerbates the ongoing humanitarian crisis. Over 230 journalists have been killed in Gaza since October 2023, many under suspicious circumstances. The erosion of protections for war correspondents signals a shift in military strategies to neutralize information messengers.</p>
<p>Calls for renewed protection of journalists and accountability for perpetrators are growing amidst mounting evidence of systematic abuses. The assassination of journalists like Anas al-Sharif underscores the urgent need for international attention to the safety of media workers in conflict zones.</p>

<div class="h2-section-wrapper"><h2>So-Young International Reports Q2 2025 Financial Results Amid Expansion of Aesthetic Centers</h2><div class="source-indicator-container"><div class="source-item" data-href="https://www.marketscreener.com/news/so-young-international-young-second-quarter-2025-earnings-release-ce7c51dedd89f121"><img class="source-favicon" src="https://www.google.com/s2/favicons?domain=www.marketscreener.com" alt="Favicon for www.marketscreener.com"></div><div class="source-item" data-href="https://www.marketscreener.com/news/so-young-reports-unaudited-second-quarter-2025-financial-results-ce7c51dedd89f520"><img class="source-favicon" src="https://www.google.com/s2/favicons?domain=www.marketscreener.com" alt="Favicon for www.marketscreener.com"></div></div></div>
<p>So-Young International Inc., a leading aesthetic treatment platform in China, announced its unaudited financial results for the second quarter ended June 30, 2025. Total revenues were RMB 378.7 million (US$52.9 million), a 7% decrease from the same period in 2024, primarily due to fewer medical service providers subscribing to information services on the platform.</p>
<p>Aesthetic treatment services revenues surged 426.1% to RMB 144.4 million (US$20.2 million), driven by the expansion of branded aesthetic centers. The number of verified treatment visits to these centers increased to over 67,400 from approximately 14,000 in Q2 2024, and active users visiting the centers exceeded 100,400 compared to around 16,000 the previous year.</p>
<p>As of June 30, 2025, So-Young operated 29 branded aesthetic centers across nine major Chinese cities, with 25 centers achieving positive monthly operating cash flow. The company aims to operate 50 centers by year-end, reflecting ongoing investments for sustainable growth.</p>
<p>Net loss attributable to So-Young was RMB 36.0 million (US$5.0 million), compared to a net income of RMB 18.9 million in Q2 2024. Non-GAAP net loss, excluding share-based compensation expenses, was RMB 30.5 million (US$4.3 million).</p>
<p>The company continues to focus on scaling its aesthetic center network, expanding proprietary product portfolios, and enhancing consumer engagement to unlock long-term value.</p>

<div class="h2-section-wrapper"><h2>Sudan’s Triangle Border Region Becomes Epicenter of Conflict and Illicit Trade</h2><div class="source-indicator-container"><div class="source-item" data-href="https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/how-sudan-and-libyas-triangle-border-region-became-hotbed-crime-and-war"><img class="source-favicon" src="https://www.google.com/s2/favicons?domain=www.middleeasteye.net" alt="Favicon for www.middleeasteye.net"></div></div></div>
<p>The desert region known as the Triangle, straddling the borders of Sudan, Libya, and Egypt, has become a focal point of conflict, crime, and smuggling. Recently, Sudan’s Rapid Support Forces (RSF) took control of the Sudanese portion of this lawless area, which serves as a critical economic and border crossing point rich in natural resources such as oil, gas, and minerals.</p>
<p>Since the fall of Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi in 2011, the Triangle has been a hotspot for illicit activities including gold mining, weapons smuggling, drug trafficking, and human trafficking. The RSF has established military bases in the area, leveraging alliances with Libyan militias connected to Khalifa Haftar’s Libyan Arab Armed Forces to control smuggling routes and extract gold.</p>
<p>The ongoing war in Sudan, involving the RSF and Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF), has intensified clashes in the Triangle, with both sides vying for control of this strategic and resource-rich region. External actors, including the United Arab Emirates, are involved, supplying weapons and support.</p>
<p>The instability in the Triangle threatens broader regional security across Libya, Sudan, and the Sahel. Porous borders and competing armed groups suggest that the conflict and criminal activities in the area will continue to pose significant challenges.</p>

<div class="h2-section-wrapper"><h2>South Korea’s President Seeks to Restore 2018 Inter-Korean Military Agreement</h2><div class="source-indicator-container"><div class="source-item" data-href="https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/south-koreas-president-vows-restore-2018-inter-korean-124667584"><img class="source-favicon" src="https://www.google.com/s2/favicons?domain=abcnews.go.com" alt="Favicon for abcnews.go.com"></div></div></div>
<p>South Korea’s newly elected liberal President Lee Jae Myung announced plans to restore the 2018 military agreement with North Korea aimed at reducing border tensions. The agreement, reached during a period of diplomatic engagement, established buffer zones and no-fly zones along the inter-Korean border to prevent accidental clashes.</p>
<p>The previous conservative South Korean government suspended the agreement in 2024 following North Korean provocations, including balloon launches, and resumed frontline military activities and propaganda campaigns. North Korea had declared it would no longer abide by the agreement.</p>
<p>President Lee emphasized that South Korea respects North Korea’s current system and does not intend to pursue unification by absorption or hostile acts. He reaffirmed South Korea’s commitment to denuclearization efforts and called on North Korea to resume dialogue with Seoul and Washington, acknowledging the complexity of denuclearization.</p>
<p>Lee’s outreach comes amid heightened tensions due to North Korea’s nuclear ambitions and its growing ties with Russia amid the Ukraine war. The president also signaled a conciliatory tone toward Japan, calling for overcoming historical grievances and strengthening future-oriented ties.</p>
