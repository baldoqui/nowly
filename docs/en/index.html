<div class="h2-section-wrapper"><h2>U.S. Researchers Medically Evacuated from McMurdo Station in Antarctica</h2><div class="source-indicator-container"><div class="source-item" data-href="https://iheart.com/content/2025-08-07-3-researchers-medically-evacuated-from-us-station-in-antarctica/"><img class="source-favicon" src="https://www.google.com/s2/favicons?domain=iheart.com" alt="Favicon for iheart.com"></div></div></div>
<p>Three researchers stationed at the U.S. McMurdo Station in Antarctica were medically evacuated this week in a complex 20-hour rescue mission conducted by the Royal New Zealand Air Force. One researcher required urgent medical care, while the other two also needed attention. The specific medical conditions and identities of the researchers have not been disclosed.</p>
<p>The operation faced extreme challenges due to severe cold and rapidly changing weather conditions. A C-130J Hercules aircraft, weighing approximately 160,000 pounds, was landed on ice at night using night vision goggles to navigate. The lack of nearby airfields for diversion south of a certain point added to the mission’s difficulty. The U.S. National Science Foundation requested the emergency evacuation, and the researchers were transported to Christchurch, New Zealand, where they are receiving treatment. The mission included "hot refueling," where the plane was refueled while engines remained running. Air Component Commander Air Commodore Andy Scott highlighted the complexity of the mission, emphasizing the detailed weather analysis and runway preparation conducted by the U.S. Antarctic Program Winter Team. Temperatures at McMurdo Station were as low as -24 Celsius (-11 Fahrenheit) during the operation.</p>

<p>The Old River Control Structure in rural Louisiana, a critical infrastructure system built in 1963, faces potential catastrophic failure due to sediment buildup and rising flood levels. This structure prevents the Mississippi River from changing its course to the Atchafalaya River, which would otherwise abandon New Orleans. The river’s natural inclination to divert threatens the 60-year-old system’s integrity, which nearly failed during the 1973 flood.</p>
<p>A failure of the structure would have severe national and regional consequences. Immediate shipping losses are estimated at $295 million daily, as the Mississippi River supports 60% of U.S. grain exports and serves major ports between Baton Rouge and New Orleans. The disruption would cause a global food crisis worse than the 2008 food crisis, potentially leading to riots and economic instability worldwide. The energy grid would also be severely impacted, as Louisiana’s industrial corridor contains vital oil refineries, import facilities, and petrochemical plants. Additionally, catastrophic flooding would devastate Lafayette and the Acadiana region, overwhelming levee systems and infrastructure, including major highways and bridges. The New Orleans metropolitan area would lose its primary drinking water source within weeks due to saltwater intrusion, requiring costly new water infrastructure.</p>
<p>Despite the urgency, political disagreements and halted funding have impeded risk assessments and mitigation efforts. The Army Corps of Engineers built backup systems in 1986, but sediment accumulation continues to threaten the structure. Experts warn that extreme weather and aging infrastructure increase the risk of failure, which would reshape the nation’s role in global commerce and pose an unprecedented economic threat.</p>

<p>Immigration raids conducted earlier this summer in Los Angeles and Southern California agricultural fields have heightened fear among immigrant communities in Monterey County, California. Although no major raids have occurred locally since the 1990s, targeted detentions have taken place, and rumors of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) activity have caused many immigrants to reduce public presence and limit spending.</p>
<p>Monterey County’s economy relies heavily on immigrant labor in agriculture and hospitality. Industry leaders report workforce shortages but note that the impact has been less severe than initially feared, partly due to information sharing and community support efforts. However, some local businesses have experienced up to a 30% decline in foot traffic, with some owners contemplating closure.</p>
<p>Undocumented farmworkers describe fear of leaving home and commuting to work, with some considering self-deportation. Families have altered routines, avoiding outings and public events. DACA recipients and mixed-status families express anxiety about uncertain immigration status and lengthy legal processes for residency. Local officials and immigrant advocates emphasize the essential contributions of immigrant workers and the negative economic and social consequences of enforcement actions. Legislative proposals aiming to provide pathways to legal status and citizenship remain pending in Congress.</p>

<div class="h2-section-wrapper"><h2>New Federal Report Confirms Majority of U.S. Calories Come from Ultra-Processed Foods</h2><div class="source-indicator-container"><div class="source-item" data-href="https://poststar.com/life-entertainment/nation-world/wellness/article_a41ea923-7b54-5b74-8599-61174fc0ace7.html"><img class="source-favicon" src="https://www.google.com/s2/favicons?domain=poststar.com" alt="Favicon for poststar.com"></div><div class="source-item" data-href="https://siouxcityjournal.com/life-entertainment/nation-world/wellness/article_a7cf7b62-de5b-5658-936a-9343c92b032e.html"><img class="source-favicon" src="https://www.google.com/s2/favicons?domain=siouxcityjournal.com" alt="Favicon for siouxcityjournal.com"></div></div></div>
<p>A new federal report by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), analyzing dietary data collected from August 2021 to August 2023, confirms that most Americans consume more than half of their daily calories from ultra-processed foods. These foods are characterized as energy-dense, hyperpalatable, and typically high in sugar, salt, and unhealthy fats.</p>
<p>The report shows that approximately 55% of total calories consumed by Americans aged one and older come from ultra-processed foods. Among adults, the figure is about 53%, while for children and teens through age 18, it reaches nearly 62%. The main sources include burgers, sandwiches, sweet baked goods, savory snacks, pizza, and sweetened drinks. Consumption is lower among young children and adults over 60 and higher among low-income adults.</p>
<p>While the high consumption levels were expected, the report notes a slight decline in ultra-processed food intake over the past decade. Health experts suggest increased awareness of the potential health risks associated with these foods, which have been linked to obesity, diabetes, and heart disease, though direct causation remains unproven.</p>
<p>The CDC used the Nova classification system to define ultra-processed foods and highlighted concerns about the accuracy of current definitions. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration and Agriculture Department are seeking input to develop a uniform definition for products in the U.S. food supply. Nutrition experts recommend reducing ultra-processed food intake by choosing less processed alternatives and reading nutrition labels carefully.</p>
<p>Additionally, the report includes an extensive ranking of the 50 most popular chain restaurants in America, reflecting their influence on American dietary habits and culture. The restaurant industry continues to face challenges from the COVID-19 pandemic, supply chain issues, inflation, and rising operational costs, with some chains experiencing closures despite adding seasonal jobs.</p>
