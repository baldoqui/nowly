<p>Armenia and Azerbaijan have signed a significant peace agreement at a White House summit facilitated by US President Donald Trump. The deal aims to end decades of conflict between the two South Caucasus nations, reopening key transportation routes and establishing a major transit corridor dubbed the "Trump Route for International Peace and Prosperity." This corridor is expected to enhance economic ties and expand US influence in the region, particularly as Russia’s role diminishes.</p>
<p>The agreement includes commitments to cease hostilities, normalize diplomatic relations, and respect territorial integrity. Both leaders praised Trump for his role in brokering the deal and indicated plans to nominate him for a Nobel Peace Prize. The peace accord also lifts restrictions on defense cooperation between Azerbaijan and the United States, a move that could further strain Moscow’s influence. However, analysts caution that the long-term success of the agreement depends on sustained US engagement to prevent renewed tensions.</p>

<p>Israel announced plans to intensify its military campaign against Hamas by gradually taking control of Gaza City. The operation, requiring mobilization of thousands of troops and likely forcible evacuation of civilians, is expected to exacerbate the ongoing humanitarian crisis in the territory. The timing of the operation remains unspecified. Hamas dismissed the plan, warning against expanded aggression.</p>
<p>Mediators from Egypt and Qatar are working on a framework proposing a simultaneous release of all hostages held by Hamas in exchange for cessation of hostilities and Israeli withdrawal. The plan includes a transitional Palestinian-Arab committee to govern Gaza and oversee reconstruction efforts. International powers, including Germany, have criticized the escalation; Germany announced it will halt military exports to Israel that could be used in Gaza until further notice.</p>

<p>In a swift response to Israel's decision to take over Gaza City, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz announced that Germany will not authorize any exports of military equipment to Israel that could be used in Gaza “until further notice.” This decision marks a significant shift by one of Israel’s strongest European allies and adds to growing international criticism of the nearly two-year conflict.</p>
<p>Merz affirmed Israel’s right to self-defense against Hamas but underscored the need for humanitarian access and a ceasefire. The German government expressed concern over the escalating military action and its impact on civilians. The suspension affects equipment supplied by German firms, which constitute about 30% of Israel’s defense imports, especially naval armaments. Other European nations, including the Netherlands, Denmark, and Slovenia, have also taken or proposed measures limiting arms exports to Israel amid the conflict.</p>

<p>US President Donald Trump announced he will meet Russian President Vladimir Putin on August 15 in Alaska to discuss ending the war in Ukraine. This high-profile summit represents a potential breakthrough after months of stalled diplomatic efforts and ongoing conflict that has lasted over three years.</p>
<p>Trump indicated that a peace deal might involve territorial exchanges between Russia and Ukraine but provided no detailed proposals. He emphasized that the meeting would precede any discussions involving Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, raising concerns about Ukraine’s role in peace negotiations. The Kremlin has yet to confirm the meeting details. Analysts note that despite the summit, significant differences remain between Moscow and Kyiv, making a lasting peace agreement uncertain.</p>

<p>The US Justice Department has escalated scrutiny of prominent critics of President Donald Trump, including New York Attorney General Letitia James and Senator Adam Schiff. Subpoenas have been issued seeking records related to lawsuits and investigations involving alleged fraud and mortgage fraud.</p>
<p>Special prosecutors have been appointed to assist in these investigations. Both James and Schiff deny wrongdoing and characterize the probes as politically motivated. These actions represent some of the most serious legal challenges faced by Trump’s opponents and reflect ongoing political tensions within the US.</p>
