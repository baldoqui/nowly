<p>The Israeli airstrike on Sunday that killed five Al Jazeera journalists in Gaza has intensified tensions with Qatar, the network’s funder and a key mediator for peace efforts. Qatar’s prime minister condemned the attack as a deliberate targeting of journalists, while Amnesty International and the UN Human Rights Office called for independent investigations, labeling the strike a grave breach of international humanitarian law. The journalists were killed outside al-Shifa Hospital in Gaza City, with Israel alleging one correspondent’s affiliation to a terrorist cell, claims disputed by Al Jazeera and analysts.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Palestinians reported the heaviest bombardments in weeks east of Gaza City, following Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu’s announcement to expedite plans for an expanded offensive aimed at Hamas. Video footage surfaced showing a Palestinian activist’s killing in the West Bank by an Israeli settler during a confrontation with unarmed Palestinians. Global protests erupted in several European capitals condemning the killings of journalists and the ongoing conflict. The European Union’s foreign policy chief called the war in Gaza increasingly dangerous and urged for an immediate ceasefire and release of hostages. France proposed a UN stabilization mission to protect civilians and disarm Hamas, while Australia criticized Netanyahu’s stance on the war. Norway’s sovereign wealth fund divested from 11 Israeli companies citing the humanitarian crisis.</p>
<p>On the diplomatic front, Hamas delegates arrived in Egypt to reaffirm their openness to ceasefire talks, though significant gaps remain over Israeli military withdrawal and Hamas’ disarmament. Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu maintains the war will continue until Hamas is eradicated. The conflict, now in its 21st month, has resulted in over 61,000 Palestinian deaths and more than 153,000 injuries, predominantly among women and children. The International Criminal Court has issued arrest warrants for Netanyahu and former Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant over war crimes allegations.</p>

Police and National Guard Deployment</h2><div class="source-indicator-container"><div class="source-item" data-href="https://www.news4jax.com/news/politics/2025/08/12/the-latest-national-guard-troops-arrive-in-washington-dc-as-trumps-federal-takeover-begins/"><img class="source-favicon" src="https://www.google.com/s2/favicons?domain=www.news4jax.com" alt="Favicon for www.news4jax.com"></div><div class="source-item" data-href="https://capitolfax.com/2025/08/12/isabel%E2%80%99s-morning-briefing-566/"><img class="source-favicon" src="https://www.google.com/s2/favicons?domain=capitolfax.com" alt="Favicon for capitolfax.com"></div></div></div>
<p>President Donald Trump has initiated a federal takeover of the Washington D.C. Metropolitan Police Department and activated 800 National Guard troops to address crime in the capital. Utilizing constitutional powers and the Home Rule Act, Trump assumed command of the police force, a move unprecedented in the city’s history. Despite city officials citing a 30-year low in violent crime, the president emphasized the need for federal intervention to combat what he described as escalating lawlessness.</p>
<p>D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser initially condemned the takeover as "unsettling and unprecedented" but later adopted a collaborative tone, highlighting the additional federal resources and affirming the police department’s operational independence. Attorney General Pam Bondi met with city officials to coordinate efforts. The takeover is authorized for up to 30 days unless extended by Congress, with city leaders warning of potential destabilization.</p>
<p>The deployment marks a rare exercise of federal authority over the nation’s capital, which historically lacked local governance until 1973. The National Guard troops began arriving at the city’s armory to support law enforcement operations.</p>

<div class="h2-section-wrapper"><h2>Eastman Kodak Issues Warning Over Business Viability Amid Financial Struggles</h2><div class="source-indicator-container"><div class="source-item" data-href="https://www.iheart.com/content/2025-08-12-iconic-us-company-warns-theres-substantial-doubt-it-can-stay-in-business/"><img class="source-favicon" src="https://www.google.com/s2/favicons?domain=www.iheart.com" alt="Favicon for www.iheart.com"></div></div></div>
<p>Eastman Kodak Co., the historic photography company founded in 1880, has announced substantial doubt about its ability to continue operating due to looming debt obligations it may not be able to meet. The Rochester, New York-based firm disclosed in a regulatory filing that it has significant debt maturing within the next 12 months but lacks committed financing or liquidity to cover these debts. This revelation caused a 13% drop in Kodak’s stock price during early trading on August 12.</p>
<p>Kodak’s Chief Financial Officer, David Bullwinkle, stated the company expects to present a plan by Friday to fulfill its pension plan obligations, with an anticipated completion of the reversion process by December. Last year, Kodak ended its retirement income plan as part of efforts to reduce debt. The company, once a global leader in film photography, faced major challenges from digital technology shifts and competition, leading to bankruptcy protection filing in 2012 and emergence in 2013 focusing on commercial and packaging printing.</p>
<p>Currently, Kodak is nearing completion of a manufacturing plant for regulated pharmaceutical products, with production expected to commence later this year.</p>

<div class="h2-section-wrapper"><h2>Iraq and Syria Discuss Revival of Kirkuk-Baniyas Oil Pipeline to Boost Energy Cooperation</h2><div class="source-indicator-container"><div class="source-item" data-href="https://www.thenationalnews.com/news/mena/2025/08/12/iraq-and-syria-discuss-revival-of-kirkukbaniyas-oil-pipeline/"><img class="source-favicon" src="https://www.google.com/s2/favicons?domain=www.thenationalnews.com" alt="Favicon for www.thenationalnews.com"></div></div></div>
<p>Iraq and Syria held talks in Baghdad on August 12 to enhance bilateral energy cooperation, including the potential revival of the Kirkuk-Baniyas oil pipeline. The pipeline, built in 1952, transported Iraqi crude oil approximately 850 kilometers to Syria’s Mediterranean port of Baniyas, with a capacity of about 300,000 barrels per day. Operations ceased in 1980 due to the Iran-Iraq War and political disputes, with brief reopening in 2000 to bypass UN sanctions.</p>
<p>Both countries agreed to establish joint technical teams to assess whether to rehabilitate the pipeline or construct a new one, amid regional instability affecting Iraq’s oil exports. The restoration would provide Iraq an alternative export route bypassing the Strait of Hormuz and supply Syria with much-needed fuel. The pipeline suffered heavy damage during the 2003 U.S.-led invasion of Iraq and remains out of service. The talks also included plans to lay fiber-optic cables alongside the pipeline to improve regional connectivity.</p>
<p>Recent months have seen increased cooperation between Iraq and Syria, including border crossings reopening and joint efforts against drug trafficking.</p>

PHP now holds significant control over Assura and plans to pursue delisting from the London Stock Exchange and Johannesburg Stock Exchange, followed by re-registration of Assura as a private limited company.</p>
