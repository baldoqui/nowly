<p>Actor Terence Stamp, renowned for his role as the villainous General Zod in multiple Superman films, has died at the age of 87, his family announced Sunday. Stamp’s career spanned seven decades, beginning with his film debut as the titular character in <em>Billy Budd</em> (1962), which earned him a Golden Globe for New Star of the Year and nominations for both an Academy Award and a BAFTA.</p>
<p>Stamp later starred in notable films such as <em>Modesty Blaise</em> and <em>Far from the Madding Crowd</em>. Despite early success, he experienced a decline in leading roles toward the late 1960s. Reflecting on this period, Stamp described it as a mystery, noting he was still in his prime but roles diminished. He embraced character acting, which led to his acclaimed portrayal of General Zod in the 1978 <em>Superman</em> film and its 1980 sequel alongside Christopher Reeve.</p>
<p>His family paid tribute, highlighting his extraordinary body of work as both actor and writer, which they said will continue to inspire. They requested privacy during this time of mourning.</p>

<p>Ahead of a critical meeting in Washington, European leaders including French President Emmanuel Macron, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, Finnish President Alexander Stubb, Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, and UK Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer confirmed their attendance alongside Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. The talks with US President Donald Trump are scheduled for Monday, following Trump’s recent summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska.</p>
<p>The meeting aims to discuss progress in ending the war in Ukraine, focusing on security guarantees and territorial issues. European leaders emphasized the necessity of Ukraine’s participation in any peace deal and rejected territorial concessions without Ukrainian consent. Macron warned that weakness toward Moscow would only invite future conflicts, while von der Leyen welcomed Trump’s proposal for NATO-style security guarantees for Ukraine, describing them as vital but needing further definition.</p>
<p>Sir Keir Starmer’s presence marks a concerted effort by European leaders to present a united front and support Zelensky amid complex negotiations with the US administration.</p>

<div class="h2-section-wrapper"><h2>US Special Envoy confirms Russia’s tentative acceptance of NATO-style security guarantees</h2><div class="source-indicator-container"><div class="source-item" data-href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/starmer-praises-trump-security-commitments-175321036.html"><img class="source-favicon" src="https://www.google.com/s2/favicons?domain=www.yahoo.com" alt="Favicon for www.yahoo.com"></div><div class="source-item" data-href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/face-the-nation-full-transcript-08-17-2025/"><img class="source-favicon" src="https://www.google.com/s2/favicons?domain=www.cbsnews.com" alt="Favicon for www.cbsnews.com"></div></div></div>
<p>Steve Witkoff, the US special envoy for Ukraine peace talks, confirmed that Russia has agreed in principle to a NATO-style collective defense guarantee for Ukraine without the country becoming a formal NATO member. This guarantee, akin to NATO’s Article 5—which treats an attack on one member as an attack on all—was described by Witkoff as “game-changing” and marks the first time Russia has accepted such a concept in negotiations.</p>
<p>Despite this concession, Witkoff acknowledged that many details remain to be worked out, including the roles of the US, Europe, and the EU in providing security. Ukrainian President Zelensky expressed cautious optimism but stressed the need for practical guarantees covering protection on land, air, and sea, and for Europe’s involvement in their development.</p>
<p>The deal is part of ongoing efforts to achieve a peace agreement, with further discussions planned during the upcoming Washington talks.</p>

<div class="h2-section-wrapper"><h2>US Secretary of State Marco Rubio outlines challenges in Ukraine peace negotiations</h2><div class="source-indicator-container"><div class="source-item" data-href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/face-the-nation-full-transcript-08-17-2025/"><img class="source-favicon" src="https://www.google.com/s2/favicons?domain=www.cbsnews.com" alt="Favicon for www.cbsnews.com"></div><div class="source-item" data-href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/full-transcript-face-nation-margaret-181652659.html"><img class="source-favicon" src="https://www.google.com/s2/favicons?domain=www.yahoo.com" alt="Favicon for www.yahoo.com"></div></div></div>
<p>In an extensive interview, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio discussed the complexities of negotiating peace between Ukraine and Russia following President Trump’s summit with Putin. Rubio emphasized that both sides must make concessions for a peace deal to be possible, noting the difficulty as Ukraine was invaded while Russia feels battlefield momentum.</p>
<p>Rubio clarified that the US does not unilaterally accept or reject terms, as peace conditions must be agreed upon by Ukraine and Russia. He acknowledged some progress in talks but cautioned that key differences remain. He reaffirmed support for Ukraine’s sovereignty and its right to security alliances to prevent future invasions.</p>
<p>Regarding security guarantees inspired by NATO’s Article 5, Rubio said detailed discussions with European partners and Ukraine will define how such guarantees would function, including possible US involvement. He also highlighted the importance of addressing Russia’s abduction of Ukrainian children, a topic raised repeatedly in negotiations.</p>
<p>Rubio defended the administration’s approach to sanctions, explaining that imposing further sanctions prematurely could derail peace talks. He dismissed media narratives suggesting European leaders are coming to Washington to shield Zelensky from US pressure, stating their presence reflects coordinated diplomatic efforts.</p>

<div class="h2-section-wrapper"><h2>Ukraine and European leaders stress no territorial concessions without Kyiv’s consent</h2><div class="source-indicator-container"><div class="source-item" data-href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/starmer-praises-trump-security-commitments-175321036.html"><img class="source-favicon" src="https://www.google.com/s2/favicons?domain=www.yahoo.com" alt="Favicon for www.yahoo.com"></div><div class="source-item" data-href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/face-the-nation-full-transcript-08-17-2025/"><img class="source-favicon" src="https://www.google.com/s2/favicons?domain=www.cbsnews.com" alt="Favicon for www.cbsnews.com"></div></div></div>
<p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen jointly reaffirmed that any territorial decisions regarding Ukraine must be made by Ukraine alone. Zelensky insisted that discussions on territorial concessions, particularly concerning the Donbas region, should occur only in a trilateral format involving Ukraine, Russia, and the US, a proposal Russia has yet to accept.</p>
<p>The leaders emphasized that negotiations can only proceed after a ceasefire or cessation of hostilities, rejecting proposals to skip directly to peace talks without halting fighting. Von der Leyen highlighted the importance of strong security guarantees for Ukraine and underscored Ukraine’s ongoing path toward EU membership as part of its security framework.</p>
<p>French President Macron echoed these positions, warning that capitulating to Russia’s demands would set a dangerous precedent and lead to future conflicts. He stressed the unity of European leaders accompanying Zelensky to Washington as a demonstration of shared commitment to Ukraine’s sovereignty and European security.</p>

<div class="h2-section-wrapper"><h2>Humanitarian concerns grow as aid efforts in Gaza continue amid blockade challenges</h2><div class="source-indicator-container"><div class="source-item" data-href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/face-the-nation-full-transcript-08-17-2025/"><img class="source-favicon" src="https://www.google.com/s2/favicons?domain=www.cbsnews.com" alt="Favicon for www.cbsnews.com"></div></div></div>
<p>World Central Kitchen founder José Andrés reported on the ongoing humanitarian crisis in Gaza, where starvation-related deaths have risen to 250, including 110 children, according to the Hamas-run Gaza Health Ministry. Andrés visited Gaza recently, observing the operations of food kitchens and warehouses, and emphasized the urgent need to increase aid delivery.</p>
<p>Despite recent easing of the blockade, aid organizations face logistical challenges, including limited truck access and the need to scale up food production to meet demand. Andrés highlighted that current meal distribution covers only about 10% of the population’s needs, and called for uninterrupted aid flow, safe transport routes, and expanded access for NGOs.</p>
<p>He stressed the importance of feeding people where they live to reduce the need for travel amid difficult conditions. The situation remains critical, with calls for sustained international support to prevent further deterioration.</p>
