<p>President Donald Trump has initiated an unprecedented federal takeover of the Washington D.C. Metropolitan Police Department, deploying 800 National Guard members to assist in reducing crime in the city. This move comes under Section 740 of the Home Rule Act, allowing the president to assume control of the local police for an initial 48 hours, extendable up to 30 days during emergencies—a power no president has exercised before. The White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt stated that the administration would reassess the situation after the 30-day period and would require congressional approval to extend the takeover.</p>
<p>D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser, after meeting with U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi, emphasized that the police department retains operational independence, including hiring and firing decisions. Despite this, federal officers have begun arrests targeting serious crimes such as homicide, gun and drug offenses, reckless driving, and fare evasion, with six illegal firearms seized overnight. The National Park Service has also removed 70 homeless encampments from federally controlled parks, and the administration announced fines or jail time for homeless individuals refusing shelter or addiction treatment.</p>
<p>Two senior Army officials visited the D.C. National Guard armory as troops reported for duty, underscoring military support for this mission. Trump also indicated plans to meet Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska this Friday, describing the summit as a “listening exercise” to better understand how to end the ongoing war in Ukraine. The White House confirmed Trump remains deeply engaged with Ukraine and European allies.</p>

<p>Eastman Kodak Company, a historic American photography and imaging firm founded in 1880, has disclosed significant doubts about its ability to continue as a going concern. The Rochester, New York-based company revealed in a regulatory filing that it faces debt obligations due within the next 12 months but lacks committed financing or sufficient liquidity to meet these payments. This announcement led to a 13% drop in Kodak’s stock price during early trading on August 12.</p>
<p>As of June 30, Kodak held $155 million in cash and cash equivalents, including $70 million in the U.S. The company’s Chief Financial Officer, David Bullwinkle, stated that Kodak expects to have a plan by Friday to satisfy pension plan participant obligations, with the pension reversion process anticipated to conclude by December. The company had previously ended its retirement income plan last year to reduce debt.</p>
<p>Kodak, once a global leader known for its Brownie and Instamatic cameras, faced severe challenges amid the digital photography revolution and competition from Japanese firms. It filed for bankruptcy protection in 2012 and emerged a year later, shifting focus to commercial and packaging printing. Currently, Kodak is nearing completion of a manufacturing plant for regulated pharmaceutical products, with production expected to commence later this year.</p>

<div class="h2-section-wrapper"><h2>Panama’s Chinese Community Faces Uncertainty Amid U.S.-China Canal Rivalry</h2><div class="source-indicator-container"><div class="source-item" data-href="https://newsroompanama.com/2025/08/12/the-chinese-community-caught-in-the-middle-in-panama/"><img class="source-favicon" src="https://www.google.com/s2/favicons?domain=newsroompanama.com" alt="Favicon for newsroompanama.com"></div></div></div>
<p>The ethnic Chinese community in Panama, Central America’s largest, is experiencing tension amid escalating U.S.-China competition over influence in the Panama Canal region. The Mirador de las Américas, a monument built in 2004 to honor Panama’s Chinese diaspora, is deteriorating and at risk of demolition, symbolizing the broader geopolitical shift as Panama pivots toward closer ties with the United States under pressure from President Donald Trump.</p>
<p>Panama has taken several steps distancing itself from China, including removing Huawei telecommunications towers, withdrawing from China’s Belt and Road Initiative, auditing and moving to cancel contracts with the Hong Kong-based company managing key canal ports, and allowing U.S. military forces to return to training facilities near the canal. Panamanian President José Raúl Mulino emphasized the country’s strong strategic partnership with the U.S., while local Chinese Panamanians express concern over the marginalization of their community’s heritage.</p>
<p>The mayor of Arraiján, where the monument is located, has refused to renew the concession for the site or engage with Chinese community leaders regarding its upkeep. Chinese Ambassador Xu Xueyuan has called for preservation of the monument as a tribute to Chinese contributions to Panama.</p>

<p>With multiple veteran Illinois congressional members retiring or seeking other offices, the state is witnessing a significant generational transition in its U.S. House delegation ahead of the 2026 midterm elections. Four Democratic-held House seats—the 2nd, 7th, 8th, and 9th districts—are open due to retirements and Senate bids, prompting competitive primaries and early campaigning.</p>
<p>In the 2nd District, candidates include Cook County Commissioner Donna Miller, State Senator Robert Peters (endorsed by Senator Bernie Sanders), former Congressman Jesse Jackson Jr., State Senator Willie Preston, and others. The 7th District sees a field including State Representative La Shawn Ford (endorsed by retiring Rep. Danny Davis), Chicago City Treasurer Melissa Conyears-Ervin, former Cook County Commissioner Richard Boykin, and others. The 8th District candidates include Cook County Commissioner Kevin Morrison and Hanover Park Trustee Yasmeen Bankole. The 9th District features a crowded Democratic primary with progressive content creator Kat Abughazaleh, Evanston Mayor Daniel Biss, State Senator Laura Fine, State Rep. Hoan Huynh, and State Senator Mike Simmons among contenders.</p>
<p>Primaries for both parties are scheduled for March 17, 2026, with petition filing deadlines in early November. Republicans aim to contest these seats to maintain or expand their narrow House majority.</p>
