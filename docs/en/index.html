<p>Severe monsoon rains have triggered catastrophic flash floods and landslides across northern Pakistan, causing widespread devastation and loss of life. The hardest-hit areas include districts in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP), Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK), and Gilgit-Baltistan (GB), with at least 330 confirmed fatalities and many more injured or missing. Bajaur, Battagram, and Buner districts in KP have suffered extensive damage, including destroyed homes and infrastructure.</p>
<p>Rescue operations are ongoing, with approximately 2,000 personnel deployed, including the Pakistan Army and local emergency teams. Helicopters are being used for evacuations and relief deliveries despite challenging weather and blocked roads. The provincial government has declared disaster-hit zones and is accelerating relief efforts. The Meteorological Department forecasts intermittent heavy rains through August 21, raising concerns about further flooding and landslides.</p>
<p>In AJK, cloudbursts have destroyed bridges and guesthouses, stranding tourists who are being rescued. In GB, several bridges were swept away, and fatalities have been reported. The disaster has drawn international attention amid warnings about the intensifying monsoon season and Pakistan's vulnerability to climate-induced extreme weather events.</p>

<p>A high-profile summit between U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin took place at Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson in Anchorage, Alaska. The meeting, arranged on short notice, featured ceremonial elements including a red carpet and military flyovers but concluded without any concrete ceasefire agreement or major announcements regarding the conflict in Ukraine.</p>
<p>Trump acknowledged progress on several points but admitted key issues remain unresolved. He indicated that future talks, potentially a trilateral meeting including Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, are being planned. Zelenskyy, excluded from the Alaska talks, accepted Trump's invitation to Washington for further discussions on ending the war.</p>
<p>Reactions from U.S. lawmakers were critical, with concerns that Trump had been outmaneuvered by Putin, who used the summit to regain global diplomatic visibility despite facing international war crime allegations. European leaders expressed disappointment, emphasizing ongoing Russian military attacks in Ukraine and the necessity of sustained pressure on Moscow.</p>
<p>Putin highlighted an agreement that would "pave the path towards peace in Ukraine" but provided no specifics. He warned European capitals against attempts to derail progress. The summit underscored the complex geopolitical dynamics surrounding the Ukraine conflict, with the U.S. and Russia maintaining divergent positions.</p>

<div class="h2-section-wrapper"><h2>Israel and U.S. Pursue Controversial Plans to Relocate Palestinians from Gaza</h2><div class="source-indicator-container"><div class="source-item" data-href="https://www.livemint.com/global/israel-is-quietly-in-talks-to-relocate-palestinians-from-gaza-11755328968766.html"><img class="source-favicon" src="https://www.google.com/s2/favicons?domain=www.livemint.com" alt="Favicon for www.livemint.com"></div></div></div>
<p>Israeli and U.S. officials continue efforts to relocate hundreds of thousands of Palestinians from the Gaza Strip, a strategy framed as humanitarian by proponents but criticized internationally as unrealistic and potentially violating international law. The plan involves seeking countries willing to resettle Palestinians who agree to leave Gaza, with discussions reportedly held with governments in Libya, South Sudan, Somaliland, and Syria.</p>
<p>Egypt, which shares a border with Gaza, has resisted proposals to resettle Palestinians in the Sinai Peninsula despite pressure. Many of the potential resettlement destinations face their own internal conflicts and economic challenges, raising questions about the feasibility of the plan.</p>
<p>The initiative has been championed by far-right Israeli officials and supported by former U.S. President Trump, who suggested transforming Gaza into a tourist destination after relocation. Legal experts caution that forcible displacement is prohibited under the Geneva Conventions except under narrow conditions, and there are concerns that voluntary emigration schemes may not be genuinely voluntary.</p>
<p>Palestinians in Gaza face dire conditions due to war-related destruction and shortages, with many expressing willingness to emigrate but fearing loss of the right to return. The ongoing conflict and humanitarian crisis complicate prospects for relocation.</p>

<p>In Major League Baseball, the Milwaukee Brewers achieved a franchise-tying 13th consecutive victory by overcoming an early seven-run deficit to defeat the Cincinnati Reds 10-8. Christian Yelich contributed two home runs and five RBIs in a four-hit performance, nearly completing a cycle. The Brewers have won 28 of their last 32 games and hold the best record in the majors at 77-44.</p>
<p>The Reds had an early 8-1 lead after a second-inning rally but were unable to maintain it as the Brewers' bullpen retired the final 23 batters. Milwaukee right-hander Jacob Misiorowski struggled in his return from injury, while Elly De La Cruz and Gavin Lux led the Reds offensively.</p>
<p>Other notable MLB results include the Pittsburgh Pirates' 3-2 win over the Chicago Cubs, Detroit Tigers' 7-0 shutout of the Minnesota Twins, and the Los Angeles Dodgers' 3-2 victory against the San Diego Padres, which moved the Dodgers into a tie for first place in the National League West.</p>

<div class="h2-section-wrapper"><h2>USAID Funding Cuts Undermine Haitian Media and Civil Society Amid Violence</h2><div class="source-indicator-container"><div class="source-item" data-href="https://haitiantimes.com/2025/08/16/silence-survival-haiti-usaid/"><img class="source-favicon" src="https://www.google.com/s2/favicons?domain=haitiantimes.com" alt="Favicon for haitiantimes.com"></div></div></div>
<p>A report highlights the detrimental impact of U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) funding cuts on Haiti’s media, LGBTQ+ organizations, and health services, exacerbating challenges amid rampant gang violence, poverty, and political instability. Attacks on journalists have increased, with equipment confiscated and press freedom severely hampered in Port-au-Prince, where gangs control an estimated 85% of the city.</p>
<p>USAID previously provided critical support to community radio stations, HIV/AIDS prevention programs, and organizations advocating for victims of gender-based violence. The withdrawal of funding has forced many groups to scale back or suspend activities, including HIV prevention services and awareness campaigns for transgender rights.</p>
<p>The political climate under former U.S. President Donald Trump, who publicly disparaged Haiti and revoked protections for Haitian migrants, has contributed to a hostile environment for civil society. Fear of reprisals and reduced international support have left grassroots organizations struggling to operate, while rising poverty and insecurity hinder public expression and civic engagement.</p>

<p>Dubai’s gross domestic product (GDP) expanded by 4 percent year-on-year in the first quarter of 2025, reaching approximately 119.7 billion dirhams (USD 32.6 billion). Growth was supported by strong performances in key sectors including human health and social work, which surged 26 percent, and wholesale and retail trade, contributing nearly a quarter of the economy.</p>
<p>Real estate activity rose 7.8 percent, with transaction volumes and values increasing significantly amid a surge of new investors. Financial and insurance services, manufacturing, accommodation, food services, transport, and information technology also recorded growth.</p>
<p>The emirate attracted 9.88 million international visitors in the first half of 2025, a 6 percent increase year-on-year, reinforcing its status as a global tourism hub.
