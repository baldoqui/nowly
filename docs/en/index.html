<p>Awdah Al Hathaleen, a 31-year-old Palestinian activist, father of three, and documentary filmmaker, was fatally shot in the West Bank village of Umm al-Khair in late July. The incident occurred during a confrontation involving a settler, Yinon Levi, who was seen on video waving and firing a handgun towards villagers. Levi, notorious for previous attacks against Palestinians and currently under European Union sanctions, was briefly held by police but released without charges after less than 24 hours.</p>
<p>Hathaleen’s death highlights escalating violence in the West Bank, where settler attacks have surged since 2023 amid government policies perceived as supportive of settlement expansion. Between January and June 2025, over 2,000 settler attacks were recorded, resulting in casualties and property damage. Palestinians have faced increasing restrictions, with activists reporting that settlers serving in the Israeli military patrol nearby communities with impunity.</p>
<p>The activist’s funeral was delayed for 10 days due to Israeli authorities holding his body, contravening Muslim burial traditions. His family accepted military-imposed restrictions to reclaim the body. European diplomats attended the funeral, expressing condemnation and concern over the vulnerability of Palestinian communities. Hathaleen was widely respected internationally for his peace activism and educational efforts, including his role in the Oscar-winning documentary "No Other Land," which chronicles Palestinian struggles against settler violence.</p>
<p>Local and international activists continue to monitor the situation, with reports of arrests of village men following the killing. Strategies to protect Palestinians have shifted towards overnight stays in homes to bear witness to violence, emphasizing documentation as a deterrent.</p>

<p>Severe wildfires fueled by extreme heat and strong winds swept through parts of Spain and other European countries, causing evacuations, destruction, and casualties. In the affluent Madrid suburb of Tres Cantos, fires destroyed homes, farmland, and facilities including an equestrian center and a donkey shelter. At least 180 people were evacuated overnight, and a man suffering burns over 98% of his body later died.</p>
<p>Fireballs and fire whirls were reported due to the combination of high temperatures, reaching up to 44°C in some regions, and wind conditions. Explosions were heard near the Norman pharmaceutical laboratories on Madrid’s outskirts as flames rapidly advanced. Firefighters managed to contain the blaze near Madrid by Tuesday morning aided by favorable conditions.</p>
<p>In northern Spain’s Castile and Leon region, hundreds were evacuated near a UNESCO-listed national park amid multiple wildfires. Thick smoke hindered aerial firefighting efforts. Similar fires also burned in Portugal, France, and Turkey, with thousands of personnel and equipment engaged in suppression efforts. The Mediterranean region’s hotter, drier summers have increased wildfire risks, exacerbated by climate change.</p>
<p>Authorities warned of continued fire risks due to ongoing heat and dry conditions. In Italy, a heatstroke death was reported amid red alert warnings in multiple cities.</p>

<div class="h2-section-wrapper"><h2>Divergent Economic Recoveries Shape Corporate Performance in Nigeria and Ghana</h2><div class="source-indicator-container"><div class="source-item" data-href="https://www.ghanabusinessnews.com/2025/08/12/west-african-titans-a-comparative-h1-2025-performance-analysis-of-key-companies-in-nigeria-and-ghana/"><img class="source-favicon" src="https://www.google.com/s2/favicons?domain=www.ghanabusinessnews.com" alt="Favicon for www.ghanabusinessnews.com"></div></div></div>
<p>A comparative analysis of the first half of 2025 reveals starkly contrasting economic trajectories in Nigeria and Ghana, influencing multinational corporate performance across sectors including telecommunications, financial services, media, and FMCG.</p>
<p>Nigeria experienced fragile stabilization after years of volatility, with the Central Bank maintaining a high interest rate of 27.5% to defend the Naira and curb inflation, which averaged 23.5%. Despite macroeconomic challenges and persistent inflation eroding consumer purchasing power, MTN Nigeria reported a remarkable turnaround with a profit after tax of ₦414.9 billion, driven by a 54.6% surge in service revenue, particularly data services. Nestlé Nigeria similarly rebounded from losses due to improved foreign exchange stability.</p>
<p>Conversely, Ghana benefited from robust fiscal discipline and successful debt restructuring, leading to a rapid drop in inflation to 13.7% and a strengthening cedi. This fostered real consumer growth and operational efficiency, enabling MTN Ghana to achieve a 55.8% profit increase and an EBITDA margin of 58.4%, surpassing its Nigerian counterpart in absolute profit. However, MultiChoice faced subscriber losses in Nigeria due to affordability issues and regulatory pressures in Ghana demanding price cuts, exposing vulnerabilities in its premium pay-TV model.</p>
<p>Ecobank reported strong pan-African growth, with profit before tax up 40% to ₦620.2 billion, benefiting from high-interest rates but facing rising loan impairment charges. Nestlé Ghana saw volume-led consumption growth amid economic recovery.</p>
<p>The findings underscore the primacy of macroeconomic environment and operational efficiency in corporate success, with regulatory dynamics shifting in response to economic conditions. Forward-looking strategies emphasize adaptation to these divergent contexts.</p>
