<p>Mexico has transferred 26 high-ranking cartel figures and other prominent criminals to the United States as part of a recent agreement with the Trump administration. The operation, confirmed by Mexico’s Attorney General’s Office and Security Ministry, involved flying these individuals to the U.S. on Tuesday. The U.S. Justice Department assured Mexican authorities that the death penalty would not be sought in any of the cases.</p>
<p>This move comes amid heightened pressure from the Trump administration to curb drug trafficking and organized crime, especially ahead of impending U.S. tariffs on Mexican imports. Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum has demonstrated a more aggressive stance on cartel pursuits compared to her predecessor but maintains a firm position against U.S. military intervention in Mexico.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, up to 800 National Guard troops have been mobilized to Washington, D.C., awaiting mission assignments to support law enforcement, with deployment expected to begin early next week. The federal takeover of the D.C. police department is ongoing, with federal officers embedded alongside local police to address violent crime.</p>
<p>The federal intervention in D.C. has sparked criticism from residents who note recent crime reductions and express concern over the presence and tactics of federal forces, particularly regarding the treatment of homeless individuals and community relations.</p>

<div class="h2-section-wrapper"><h2>Man Pleads Guilty to Smuggling $1.4 Million Worth of Protected Turtles and Animals to Hong Kong</h2><div class="source-indicator-container"><div class="source-item" data-href="https://www.iheart.com/content/2025-08-12-man-caught-smuggling-turtles-worth-14-million-hidden-in-socks/"><img class="source-favicon" src="https://www.google.com/s2/favicons?domain=www.iheart.com" alt="Favicon for www.iheart.com"></div></div></div>
<p>Wei Qiang Lin, a Chinese national residing in Brooklyn, has pleaded guilty to smuggling approximately 850 protected turtles and other animals valued at $1.4 million from the United States to Hong Kong. The smuggling operation, which lasted over a year until November 2024, involved 222 packages disguised as "plastic animal toys."</p>
<p>Law enforcement officials intercepted the shipments at JFK Airport in Queens, discovering turtles—including eastern box turtles and three-toed turtles—bound and taped inside knotted socks and diapers. The operation also involved the seizure of seven venomous snakes and 28 lizards. Only a few packages successfully reached Hong Kong before the operation was shut down following undercover sales that led to Lin’s arrest.</p>
<p>He faces up to five years in prison and fines up to $250,000, with sentencing scheduled for December 23.</p>

<div class="h2-section-wrapper"><h2>South African Police Linked to $200 Million Cocaine Theft in KwaZulu-Natal Amid Corruption Scandal</h2><div class="source-indicator-container"><div class="source-item" data-href="https://www.dailymaverick.co.za/article/2025-08-12-suspicious-r200m-cocaine-theft-from-kzn-hawks-office-likely-links-police-to-global-drug-traffickers/"><img class="source-favicon" src="https://www.google.com/s2/favicons?domain=www.dailymaverick.co.za" alt="Favicon for www.dailymaverick.co.za"></div></div></div>
<p>A significant cocaine theft involving 541 kilograms valued at over R200 million occurred at the Hawks offices in Port Shepstone, KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa, in November 2021. The cocaine had been seized months earlier at a container depot in Isipingo, Durban, but was stored insecurely, leading to its theft. The stolen cocaine bore Jaguar logos, linked to the Sinaloa Cartel, raising suspicions of cartel involvement and internal police collusion.</p>
<p>KwaZulu-Natal Police Commissioner Lieutenant-General Nhlanhla Mkhwanazi has alleged the existence of a high-level criminal syndicate infiltrating the police, judiciary, and other state institutions. The scandal ties into broader issues of corruption, including the murder of DJ Sumbody, allegedly connected to the drug trade and police complicity.</p>
<p>Despite ongoing investigations and a Commission of Inquiry announced by President Cyril Ramaphosa, many questions remain about accountability and police protocol breaches, including why the cocaine was not stored at the designated forensic laboratory.</p>

<div class="h2-section-wrapper"><h2>U.S. Sanctuary Policies in Schools Strengthened Amid Federal Immigration Enforcement Pressure</h2><div class="source-indicator-container"><div class="source-item" data-href="https://progressive.org/magazine/a-sanctuary-fights-back-duda-20250812/"><img class="source-favicon" src="https://www.google.com/s2/favicons?domain=progressive.org" alt="Favicon for progressive.org"></div></div></div>
<p>In Chicago, the Chicago Teachers Union (CTU) has successfully negotiated sanctuary language into its contracts to protect immigrant students and staff from Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) actions within schools. Following an incident in January 2025 where federal agents attempted to enter Hamline Elementary School, the union’s training and protocols ensured agents were denied entry without a warrant, and the school community was mobilized to protect students’ rights.</p>
<p>The CTU’s sanctuary provisions include training on immigrant rights and resources for affected families, aligning with city and state sanctuary policies. Despite federal efforts under the Trump administration to increase immigration enforcement and remove protections at sensitive locations such as schools and churches, Chicago’s policies remain robust.</p>
<p>The union’s approach emphasizes community organizing and alliances to maintain safe educational environments for immigrant families, even as challenges from federal authorities continue. Similar efforts and debates are ongoing in other sanctuary cities and states.</p>
