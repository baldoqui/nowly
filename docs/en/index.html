<p>Following President Donald Trump’s unprecedented announcement, his administration has taken control of the Washington, D.C. police department and deployed 800 National Guard troops to the city for at least a month. The White House reported a round-the-clock presence of local and federal law enforcement officers, with over 1,650 personnel participating in the operation. In the first night, 45 arrests were made, including 29 individuals living in the country illegally. Arrests were related to offenses such as drug possession, carrying concealed weapons, and assaulting federal officers.</p>
<p>Pentagon press secretary Kingsley Wilson clarified that while the National Guard can temporarily detain individuals, they do not have arrest powers. The federalization effort also includes clearing homeless encampments and relocating residents, though details remain unclear. Washington officials have proactively begun closing some encampments to provide stronger social services to those displaced. The move has drawn criticism from civil rights groups and local officials, who describe it as an unnecessary takeover and a threat to civil rights. Mayor Muriel Bowser called the takeover an “authoritarian push” but also noted it could boost public safety. Similar sentiments were expressed by mayors of other major cities named by Trump as potential targets for federal intervention.</p>
<p>The White House also announced enhanced cooperation between the D.C. police and federal immigration authorities, allowing local officers to share information and provide transportation for federal immigration employees. The initiative aims to target specific gang members, drug dealers, and high-crime locations with specialized teams operating 24/7.</p>

<p>The upcoming summit between U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin, scheduled to take place at Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson near Anchorage, Alaska, has sparked apprehension in Kyiv and among international observers. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy warned that peace talks excluding Ukraine would produce “stillborn” and “unworkable” decisions. He emphasized that any territorial concessions must be decided by Ukraine with binding security guarantees.</p>
<p>The summit is seen as a critical juncture amid ongoing conflict in Ukraine, with Russia demanding recognition of its annexation of Crimea and other occupied territories, and Ukraine seeking to maintain sovereignty and NATO aspirations. Key issues expected to be discussed include territorial disputes, NATO membership, limits on Ukraine’s military, and the lifting of international sanctions on Russia.</p>
<p>Critics liken the summit to the 1938 Munich Agreement, fearing it may serve as a platform for Russia to influence U.S. policy and undermine Ukraine’s position. Trump described the meeting as “big” and “good,” indicating plans for a subsequent meeting involving both Putin and Zelenskyy, potentially including European leaders. He also suggested the possibility of discussing rare earth mineral deals with Russia.</p>

<p>The United States has dispatched two warships, the USS Higgins and USS Cincinnati, to the Scarborough Shoal in the disputed South China Sea following a collision between two Chinese ships earlier in the week. The collision occurred as Chinese vessels were attempting to block a smaller Philippine coast guard ship operating in the area.</p>
<p>Scarborough Shoal is claimed by China and the Philippines, with overlapping claims also from Vietnam, Malaysia, Brunei, and Taiwan. The U.S. Navy’s deployment is part of ongoing freedom-of-navigation operations aimed at challenging China’s maritime claims and restrictions. The warships were shadowed by a Chinese navy vessel but no incidents were reported.</p>
<p>The Philippines and its allies have condemned the collision and called for adherence to international maritime laws. Japan, Australia, and New Zealand expressed concern over the dangerous maneuvers leading to the collision in this vital global trade route.</p>

<p>On August 8, Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan and Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev signed a joint declaration in Washington, D.C., mediated by U.S. President Donald Trump, to reopen transport and communication links between their countries. The agreement includes a transport corridor through Armenia’s Syunik Province, connecting mainland Azerbaijan with the Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic, operated by a private American company on a 99-year lease.</p>
<p>The deal aims to normalize relations and end hostilities, with additional accords on trade, economic cooperation, innovation, and energy partnerships signed alongside. Azerbaijan gains a direct land link to Nakhchivan, while Turkey sees the corridor as a strategic bridge for pan-Turkic integration. Europe views it as a safer route for Central Asian energy supplies, bypassing Russia and Iran. The U.S. regards it as a strategic asset for energy transport and potential military logistics.</p>
<p>However, the deal faces significant challenges. Azerbaijan demands Armenia revise its constitution to remove territorial claims, and the corridor’s operation under foreign control raises sovereignty concerns. Analysts warn the agreement may not guarantee lasting peace due to Azerbaijan’s maximalist rhetoric and military buildup, and the absence of clear international guarantees. Russia and Iran express unease, viewing the corridor as a threat to regional balance and their influence.</p>
<p>The corridor, dubbed the “Trump Route,” symbolizes broader geopolitical competition involving Baku, Ankara, Washington, Brussels, Moscow, and Tehran. Its future depends on managing domestic and international tensions and building mutual trust.</p>

<p>Angelica Rubio, a Democratic state representative from Las Cruces, New Mexico, is actively advocating for the creation of Anioma State, a new state proposed to encompass the nine local government areas of Delta North district. Rubio emphasizes the movement’s foundation in linguistic affinity, cultural heritage, and the pursuit of socio-economic development.</p>
<p>The Anioma people share strong linguistic ties with the Igbo ethno-linguistic group, supporting their alignment with Nigeria’s South-east geopolitical zone. Rubio highlights the historical aspirations of the Anioma people for recognition and self-governance, arguing that statehood would enable tailored policies, infrastructure development, and political representation.</p>
<p>Despite internal political challenges and opposition, Rubio remains committed to progressive policies without compromising her values. She undertook a symbolic bicycle journey across New Mexico to engage with diverse communities, aiming to bridge divides between rural and urban areas and foster political inclusivity.</p>
<p>The push for Anioma State is framed as a national imperative that transcends geopolitical boundaries, seeking to empower the Anioma people and strengthen Nigeria’s federal system.</p>

<p>The 80th anniversary of Japan’s unconditional surrender has been marked by contrasting cinematic portrayals of World War II in China and Japan, highlighting ongoing historical and cultural disputes. Chinese films released this summer, such as <em>Dead to Rights</em>, <em>Dongji Rescue</em>, and <em>731 Biochemical Revelations</em>, focus on documenting Japanese wartime atrocities, commemorating resistance, and promoting justice and peace.</p>
<p>Conversely, several Japanese WWII films released or re-released during the same period emphasize Japan’s suffering and victimhood, often downplaying or omitting its role as an aggressor. Titles like <em>Kurokawa no Onnatachi</em>, <em>Nagasaki: In the Shadow of the Flash</em>, and <em>Yukikaze</em> present narratives centered on Japanese civilians’ and soldiers’ hardships, fostering a “victim mentality.” This approach has been criticized by Chinese scholars and some Japanese filmmakers for lacking comprehensive reflection and historical accountability.</p>
<p>Experts attribute Japan’s divergent narrative to generational shifts, political climate, and a lack of judicial reckoning comparable to Germany’s postwar process. The persistence of historical revisionism and nationalist rhetoric contributes to collective amnesia regarding Japan’s wartime actions. Chinese filmmakers view their works as resistance and truth-revelation efforts in this ongoing “war of film narratives.”</p>
<p>The contrasting portrayals underscore the enduring challenges in reconciling historical memory and the role of cinema in shaping national identity and international relations.</p>
