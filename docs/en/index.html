<p>Germany has announced a suspension of arms exports to Israel that could be used in Gaza, citing concerns over Israel’s recent military operations in the Gaza Strip. Chancellor Friedrich Merz stated that it had become "increasingly difficult to understand" how Israel’s expansion of military control in Gaza, including plans to seize Gaza City, would help achieve security goals. This marks a significant shift for Germany, which had been one of Israel’s strongest European allies.</p>
<p>The decision follows Israel’s security cabinet approval of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s plan to extend military control over the remaining parts of Gaza not currently under Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) control. The move has drawn widespread international condemnation, including from UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer, who urged Israel to reconsider, warning it would "only bring more bloodshed." The European Union’s leadership, including European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, called for an immediate ceasefire and unhindered humanitarian access to Gaza.</p>
<p>Germany’s embargo specifically targets military equipment intended for use in Gaza, though arms sales for operations in the occupied West Bank are expected to continue. The decision is likely to further isolate Israel within Europe amid growing debates on the conflict. Belgium has also expressed "total disapproval" by summoning the Israeli ambassador. Meanwhile, Hamas warned that Israel’s offensive risks sacrificing the hostages held in Gaza.</p>

<div class="h2-section-wrapper"><h2>Belarus President Lukashenko Details US-Belarus Talks and Russia Relations</h2><div class="source-indicator-container"><div class="source-item" data-href="https://eng.belta.by/president/view/lukashenkos-time-interview-highlights-us-talks-putin-trump-meeting-ukraine-successor-170319-2025/"><img class="source-favicon" src="https://www.google.com/s2/favicons?domain=eng.belta.by" alt="Favicon for eng.belta.by"></div></div></div>
<p>Belarusian President Aleksandr Lukashenko gave a comprehensive interview to TIME Magazine, revealing insights into recent informal talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin and ongoing diplomatic engagement with the United States. Lukashenko described backchannel communications with US officials, primarily through intelligence channels, and highlighted the role of Deputy Assistant Secretary Christopher Smith in facilitating US delegations to Belarus, including a recent visit by former US envoy Keith Kellogg.</p>
<p>The Belarus leader emphasized that while Belarus is open to dialogue with the US, it does not expect immediate sanctions relief or formal normalization, noting the absence of a US ambassador in Minsk. Lukashenko also expressed a positive personal view of Donald Trump but criticized his contradictory public statements and the political environment surrounding him.</p>
<p>On Belarus-Russia relations, Lukashenko stressed the close military and economic ties, including mutual security guarantees that an attack on one is an attack on the other. He rejected claims that Belarus is a Russian puppet, underscoring Belarus’s strategic autonomy and multi-vector diplomacy. Lukashenko also discussed efforts to mediate between Russia and Ukraine, including relaying proposals for aerial ceasefires, which Russia supports conditional on Ukraine halting strikes.</p>
<p>Regarding the ongoing conflict in Ukraine, Lukashenko described Belarus’s role in facilitating prisoner exchanges and humanitarian efforts while refraining from direct military involvement. He reiterated Russia’s commitment to avoiding conflict with NATO and dismissed rumors of imminent war with NATO countries.</p>
<p>Lukashenko also addressed domestic political questions, denying that his son is a successor and expressing openness to future leadership that builds on existing state foundations. He proposed organizing a trilateral meeting between Putin, Trump, and Ukrainian President Zelenskyy to facilitate peace negotiations, though he acknowledged Zelenskyy’s likely reluctance to participate.</p>

<p>The Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) has recently showcased its military strength in celebrations of its 98th anniversary, including the debut of its fourth Type 075 amphibious assault ship and a documentary series depicting amphibious assaults and confrontations in the South China Sea. The documentary included footage of the China Coast Guard towing a Philippine vessel near the Second Thomas Shoal, eliciting accusations from the Philippines of propaganda using recycled footage.</p>
<p>Taiwan is preparing for potential Chinese aggression, with a Taiwanese television series titled "Zero Day Attack" set to premiere, dramatizing scenarios of PRC invasion and emphasizing information and cognitive warfare tactics. The PRC condemned the series as war-mongering, while Taiwan focuses on societal resilience and civilian preparedness.</p>
<p>Chinese Coast Guard vessels have increased patrols near Taiwan’s Pratas Island and the disputed Senkaku Islands, frequently entering Japanese territorial waters, prompting warnings and diplomatic protests. These activities are part of a broader pattern of maritime assertiveness by China in contested waters.</p>
<p>The PLA and Russian naval forces conducted joint maritime exercises near Vladivostok, featuring live-fire drills and submarine participation, signaling deepening military cooperation aimed at countering security threats in the Western Pacific. This partnership underscores the strategic alignment of Beijing and Moscow amid ongoing geopolitical tensions.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, North Korean oil tankers, some under UN sanctions, have been allowed by China to sail through its waters, violating international sanctions and reflecting growing PRC-Russia-North Korea alignment.</p>
<p>In Southeast Asia, Chinese research vessels have conducted seabed mapping in disputed maritime zones near the Philippines and Vietnam, likely to support submarine navigation and naval operations.</p>
<p>The United States maintains bipartisan congressional support for Taiwan, with planned visits by US lawmakers despite PRC opposition. The PRC continues to pressure foreign academic and diaspora communities to suppress discussions on Taiwan sovereignty.</p>

<div class="h2-section-wrapper"><h2>US-Russia Negotiations on Ukraine Truce and Trump-Putin Summit Plans</h2><div class="source-indicator-container"><div class="source-item" data-href="https://dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14983523/US-Russia-Ukraine-truce-deal-Putins-territorial-gains-summit-Trump.html"><img class="source-favicon" src="https://www.google.com/s2/favicons?domain=dailymail.co.uk" alt="Favicon for dailymail.co.uk"></div><div class="source-item" data-href="https://www.justsecurity.org/118693/early-edition-august-8-2025/"><img class="source-favicon" src="https://www.google.com/s2/favicons?domain=www.justsecurity.org" alt="Favicon for www.justsecurity.org"></div></div></div>
<p>US and Russian officials are reportedly working toward a truce deal to halt the war in Ukraine that would formalize Russia’s control over territories seized since its 2022 invasion, including the Donbas region and Crimea. The proposed agreement, aiming for a summit between US President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin possibly next week, would require Ukraine to withdraw troops from certain areas and Russia to cease attacks along current frontlines in Kherson and Zaporizhzhia.</p>
<p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky remains skeptical about a diplomatic solution, with frontline soldiers expressing little hope amid ongoing intense fighting. The US has imposed escalating sanctions and secondary tariffs targeting countries, including India, for buying Russian oil as part of pressure tactics.</p>
<p>Putin has expressed willingness to meet Trump but has set conditions for talks with Zelensky, which have yet to be met. The Kremlin highlighted ongoing diplomatic engagement with key allies and China, reinforcing Russia’s intent to consolidate influence in Eurasia.</p>
<p>The planned peace summit at the White House between Armenia and Azerbaijan, brokered by Trump, aims to end decades of conflict and establish a transit corridor connecting Azerbaijan and its Nakhchivan exclave, signaling a geopolitical setback for Russia’s regional influence.</p>

<div class="h2-section-wrapper"><h2>US Citizens File Lawsuit Against UN Agency UNRWA Over Terrorism Allegations</h2><div class="source-indicator-container"><div class="source-item" data-href="https://www.woad.com/syndicated-article/?id=1631662"><img class="source-favicon" src="https://www.google.com/s2/favicons?domain=www.woad.com" alt="Favicon for www.woad.com"></div><div class="source-item" data-href="https://www.madrock1025.com/syndicated-article/?id=1631662"><img class="source-favicon" src="https://www.google.com/s2/favicons?domain=www.madrock1025.com" alt="Favicon for www.madrock1025.com"></div><div class="source-item" data-href="https://www.centralmoinfo.com/syndicated-article/?id=1631662"><img class="source-favicon" src="https://www.google.com/s2/favicons?domain=www.centralmoinfo.com" alt="Favicon for www.centralmoinfo.com"></div></div></div>
<p>Approximately 200 US citizens, including victims and family members of Hamas and Hezbollah attacks, have filed a lawsuit in Washington, D.C., against the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) and its US-based nonprofit, UNRWA USA. The plaintiffs accuse the agency of violating anti-terrorism laws by allegedly providing material support to Hamas and Hezbollah and employing staff involved in terror activities.</p>
<p>UNRWA condemned the lawsuit as "meritless, absurd, dangerous, and morally reprehensible," defending its humanitarian mission and denying the allegations. The lawsuit seeks compensatory and punitive damages for harms suffered, including those related to the October 7, 2023 Hamas attacks.</p>
<p>The Biden administration had supported UNRWA’s immunity from civil litigation as a UN subsidiary, but the Trump administration reversed this stance in April 2025, declaring the agency not immune from such lawsuits. The Trump administration has also called for the dismantling of UNRWA, citing concerns about infiltration by terrorist groups.</p>
<p>UNRWA funding from the US remains paused since January 2024 amid investigations into the agency’s role and allegations of wrongdoing. The agency reported that food parcels in Gaza ran out several weeks ago, with no supplies entering the territory since March 2025, raising concerns about the humanitarian situation.</p>

<div class="h2-section-wrapper"><h2>China Successfully Completes Test of Manned Lunar Lander</h2><div class="source-indicator-container"><div class="source-item" data-href="http://www.81.cn/ChinaMilitary/rdxw_208665/16401603.html"><img class="source-favicon" src="https://www.google.com/s2/favicons?domain=www.81.cn" alt="Favicon for www.81.cn"></div></div></div>
<p>China announced the successful completion of a comprehensive test of its manned lunar lander, Lanyue, at a test site in Huailai County, Hebei Province. The test, finalized on August 6, marks the first time China has conducted an extraterrestrial landing and takeoff test of a manned spacecraft.</p>
<p>The Lanyue lander consists of a landing module and a propulsion module, designed to transport two astronauts between lunar orbit and the moon’s surface. It will carry a lunar rover and scientific payloads, and serve as a life-support, energy, and data center during lunar surface missions.</p>
<p>This milestone represents a breakthrough in China’s manned lunar exploration program, advancing its goal to land astronauts on the moon before 2030 for scientific exploration. The China Manned Space Agency highlighted the technical challenges overcome during the long and complex test.</p>

<div class="h2-section-wrapper"><h2>US Federal Law Enforcement Presence Increased in Washington, D.C.</h2><div class="source-indicator-container"><div class="source-item" data-href="https://www.ksat.com/news/politics/2025/08/08/the-latest-trump-orders-federal-law-enforcers-onto-streets-of-washington-dc/"><img class="source-favicon" src="https://www.google.com/s2/favicons?domain=www.ksat.com" alt="Favicon for www.ksat.com"></div><div class="source-item" data-href="https://santamariatimes.com/ap/national/the-latest-trump-orders-federal-law-enforcers-onto-streets-of-washington-dc/article_9f221fb6-d529-57cd-8bb9-0f3c2ff90e2c.html"><img class="source-favicon" src="https://www.google.com/s2/favicons?domain=santamariatimes.com" alt="Favicon for santamariatimes.com"></div></div></div>
<p>Following an attempted carjacking incident in Washington, D.C., President Donald Trump ordered an increased presence of federal law enforcement officers on the city’s streets for at least one week. Trump stated, "We have to run D.C.," though such a federal takeover would require Congressional repeal of the Home Rule Act of 1973 and faces potential opposition.</p>
<p>Despite the announcement, a late-night patrol found no evidence of the large multiagency deployment described. Crime statistics indicate that carjackings and homicides in D.C. have actually decreased after a spike in 2023.</p>
<p>The move is part of broader federal efforts to address public safety concerns in the capital, with additional federal agencies, including the FBI and National Guard, involved in the planned law enforcement boost.</p>
