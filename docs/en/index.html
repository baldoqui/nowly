<p>U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) announced 33 tentative selections for new reimbursable services agreements aimed at enhancing cross-border trade and facilitating essential travel to the United States. The Reimbursable Services Program enables private sector and state and local governments to finance additional inspection services beyond standard operations, including at remote locations or outside typical port hours. These expanded services cover customs, agricultural processing, border security, immigration inspections, and support services at ports of entry.</p>
<p>Since its inception in 2013, the program has grown to include 608 stakeholders, providing over 1.65 million additional processing hours that have processed more than 21.8 million travelers and 2.4 million personal and commercial vehicles. The new agreements span multiple U.S. states and territories, including Alabama, Arizona, California, Florida, New York, Texas, and Puerto Rico, among others. Selected entities include aviation management companies, ship agencies, and corporations such as General Motors LLC, which will operate across air, land, and sea environments. CBP emphasizes that these partnerships enhance national security while promoting lawful and expedited trade and travel.</p>

<p>The Los Angeles Angels secured a 6-5 victory over the Los Angeles Dodgers on August 13, 2025, at Angel Stadium, completing a 6-0 season sweep of their regional rivals. The Angels rallied from an early three-run deficit, with Logan O’Hoppe delivering a go-ahead two-run single in the eighth inning. The win pushed the Dodgers out of first place in the National League West for the first time since April 27, leaving them one game behind the San Diego Padres.</p>
<p>Dodgers starting pitcher Shohei Ohtani, facing his former team, allowed several runs and was relieved after reaching a season-high 80 pitches. The Dodgers bullpen struggled, blowing their fourth save in seven games. Angels closer Kenley Jansen pitched on three consecutive days to secure the win and highlighted the team's renewed playoff hopes, as they remain five games behind the third American League wild card spot. Dodgers manager Dave Roberts acknowledged the team's recent struggles and emphasized accountability ahead of a critical upcoming series against the Padres.</p>

<p>Russia continues to escalate its use of drones and missiles in the ongoing conflict in Ukraine, launching waves of attacks that have brought the front lines directly into urban centers such as Kyiv and Kharkiv. On July 21, a single Iranian-designed Shahed drone caused significant damage to a Kyiv apartment building. In one night, Russia launched approximately 450 projectiles, including 200 Shahed drones and 200 Gerbera decoys, overwhelming Ukrainian air defenses.</p>
<p>Ukraine is responding with its own drone strikes deep inside Russian territory, targeting strategic military infrastructure. Ukrainian officials report detecting around 50 independent drone attacks daily. The conflict has introduced a new paradigm in modern warfare, emphasizing the role of drones in surveillance, supply, and combat operations. Despite the growing drone threat, experts emphasize that ground forces remain essential to holding territory. The war has resulted in significant civilian hardship and displacement, with millions affected.</p>

<p>India is preparing to boost diplomatic engagement with Russia and China amid strained trade relations with the United States. External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar is scheduled to visit Moscow on August 21 to meet Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, marking their third meeting in recent weeks. The agenda includes bilateral cooperation and discussions on trade, economic, scientific, and cultural ties, as well as the ongoing conflict in Ukraine. Jaishankar's visit is expected to lay groundwork for a forthcoming annual summit between Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Russian President Vladimir Putin.</p>
<p>Prior to Jaishankar's trip, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi is expected to visit New Delhi around August 18 for high-level talks with India's National Security Adviser Ajit Doval. This will be the first senior Chinese visit since the May 2025 India-Pakistan conflict. The visit aims to continue dialogue on border issues and bilateral relations, with India cautiously navigating ties due to China's close relationship with Pakistan. India’s engagement with Russia persists despite U.S. tariffs imposed over India's purchase of Russian oil. India also seeks to maintain balanced relations as it prepares for the upcoming Shanghai Cooperation Organisation summit in China later this month.</p>

<p>Vance’s visit follows a recent trip by President Donald Trump to Scotland and includes prior engagements in the UK such as a meeting at Chevening House in Kent.

<p>Renault has introduced the 2025 Renault Duster to the Australian market, positioning it as a competitively priced, manual-transmission small SUV with off-road capabilities. The Duster is available in two powertrain options: a 1.3-litre turbocharged four-cylinder paired with an automatic transmission and front-wheel drive, and a 1.2-litre turbocharged three-cylinder mild-hybrid with manual transmission and all-wheel drive. Notably, the manual all-wheel-drive variant is the top-tier offering, a unique configuration in the segment.</p>
<p>The Duster features a 10.1-inch touchscreen infotainment system with wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, digital instrument cluster, dual-zone climate control, and a suite of safety features including autonomous emergency braking and lane-keep assist. It offers practical advantages such as a full-size spare tire and notable approach and departure angles for light off-roading. Pricing ranges from AUD 31,990 to AUD 37,990 before on-road costs. The Duster aims to compete with models like the Suzuki Jimny and Subaru Crosstrek, with early sales indicating strong interest. Critics note the absence of an automatic all-wheel-drive variant and heated seats as minor drawbacks.</p>
