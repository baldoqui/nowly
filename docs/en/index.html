Police Commissioner Amid Federal Takeover</h2><div class="source-indicator-container"><div class="source-item" data-href="https://sofrep.com/news/sofrep-daily-2025-aug-15-am/"><img class="source-favicon" src="https://www.google.com/s2/favicons?domain=sofrep.com" alt="Favicon for sofrep.com"></div><div class="source-item" data-href="https://www.denverpost.com/2025/08/14/dc-police-immigration/"><img class="source-favicon" src="https://www.google.com/s2/favicons?domain=www.denverpost.com" alt="Favicon for www.denverpost.com"></div></div></div>
<p>The Trump administration intensified its federal law enforcement takeover of Washington, D.C., by appointing Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) chief Terry Cole as the “emergency police commissioner,” granting him full authority over the Metropolitan Police Department (MPD). Attorney General Pam Bondi issued a directive stating that MPD must seek Cole’s approval before issuing any orders, effectively rescinding city policies that limited cooperation with federal immigration enforcement.</p>
<p>This move sparked immediate pushback from D.C. officials, including Attorney General Brian Schwalb and Mayor Muriel Bowser, who deemed the directive unlawful and insisted that MPD officers continue to follow city-appointed leadership. The takeover coincides with a visible increase in federal forces and National Guard patrols throughout the city, including deployments at prominent landmarks and transportation hubs. The administration framed the action as part of a broader crackdown on crime and illegal immigration, while critics warned it represented an unprecedented assertion of federal power over local governance.</p>
<p>Bondi’s directive also rescinded MPD policies limiting inquiries into immigration status and forbidding arrests based solely on federal immigration warrants. The ongoing federal presence includes National Guard troops assisting with monument security, community safety patrols, and beautification efforts, though they are reportedly unarmed and not making arrests. The heightened law enforcement activity has led to the clearing of homeless encampments, drawing concern from advocacy groups.</p>

<p>U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin met in Alaska for a high-stakes summit aimed at discussing a ceasefire and potential peace deal to end the war in Ukraine. The meeting, held at a military base near Anchorage, was the first face-to-face encounter between the two leaders in seven years. Trump described the summit as a "feel-out meeting" intended to set the stage for future negotiations, possibly including Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in subsequent talks.</p>
<p>Putin’s objectives reportedly include securing a halt to Western arms supplies to Ukraine, recognition of Russia’s territorial gains—including Crimea, Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia, and Kherson—and a legally binding pledge that Ukraine will remain neutral and not join NATO. Ukraine has rejected any territorial concessions and insists on full withdrawal of Russian forces. The differing aims of the parties underscore the summit’s complexity, with European allies and Ukraine watching closely as their interests risk being sidelined.</p>
<p>The summit included one-on-one discussions, delegation meetings, and working breakfasts, but no immediate breakthroughs were expected. Both leaders acknowledged the challenges ahead, with Trump estimating a 25% chance of failure. The meeting’s outcome could influence the trajectory of the war, European security, and U.S.-Russia relations, amid ongoing fighting and territorial disputes in eastern and southern Ukraine.</p>

<div class="h2-section-wrapper"><h2>EPA Approves Expansion of Nuclear Waste Storage at New Mexico’s WIPP Site</h2><div class="source-indicator-container"><div class="source-item" data-href="https://kunm.org/kunm-news-update/2025-08-15/fri-epa-approves-more-nuclear-waste-storage-at-new-mexico-wipp-site-more"><img class="source-favicon" src="https://www.google.com/s2/favicons?domain=kunm.org" alt="Favicon for kunm.org"></div></div></div>
<p>The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has approved the addition of two new underground storage panels at the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP) near Carlsbad, New Mexico—the only permanent nuclear waste repository in the United States. The expansion is necessary due to contamination in a previous storage area that rendered it unusable. WIPP stores transuranic radioactive waste in salt chambers approximately half a mile underground, where salt naturally seals the waste.</p>
<p>The New Mexico Environment Department (NMED) had previously approved the expansion in 2023 with conditions prioritizing legacy waste—radioactive materials from Cold War-era activities—over new weapon development waste. However, NMED officials express concerns that the Department of Energy (DOE) has not fully complied with cleanup commitments, particularly regarding an unlined dump site containing legacy waste.</p>
<p>Environmental and community groups caution that WIPP was not designed to be the sole permanent repository and emphasize the need for alternative facilities to prevent overburdening New Mexico. The approval marks a significant step in managing the nation’s nuclear waste but highlights ongoing regulatory and environmental challenges.</p>

<p>ASP Isotopes Inc., along with its subsidiary Quantum Leap Energy LLC, has entered into a memorandum of understanding (MOU) with Fermi America LLC to develop advanced nuclear fuel enrichment and stable isotope production facilities at the planned HyperGrid campus near Amarillo, Texas. The joint venture aims to research, develop, and commercially produce High Assay Low Enriched Uranium (HALEU) fuel for small modular reactors, as well as stable isotopes and advanced materials critical for quantum computing, nuclear medicine, and other emerging technologies.</p>
<p>The HyperGrid campus, co-founded by former U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry, is envisioned as the world’s largest hybrid energy and data infrastructure campus, expected to provide 11 gigawatts of power. The site’s proximity to the DOE-operated Pantex Plant offers strategic advantages, including regulatory pre-qualification for nuclear deployment.</p>
<p>The initiative reflects growing demand for advanced nuclear fuels to support expanding nuclear energy applications, particularly in AI infrastructure. ASP Isotopes and Quantum Leap Energy plan to scale production capabilities domestically, reducing reliance on imports and advancing U.S. leadership in nuclear technology.</p>

<p>The United Kingdom marked the 80th anniversary of Victory over Japan (VJ) Day with a National Service of Remembrance held at the National Memorial Arboretum in Staffordshire. The event, led by Their Majesties The King and Queen, honored those who fought and lost their lives during the final months of the Second World War in the Far East.</p>
<p>The service recognized the contributions of British Armed Forces personnel and soldiers from Commonwealth countries including pre-partition India, Australia, New Zealand, Canada, Nepal, and various African nations. Attendees included veterans, Burma Star recipients, a veteran of the British Indian Army, Prisoners of War, government officials, and diplomats including the Japanese Ambassador.</p>
<p>Military bands and a guard of honor from the Royal Navy, British Army, and Royal Air Force participated, with a flypast by the Battle of Britain Memorial Flight and the Royal Air Force’s Red Arrows. The commemoration highlighted the often-overlooked Asian theatre of the war and the sacrifices made by diverse forces.</p>
