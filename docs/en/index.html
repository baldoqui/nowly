Police Under Federal Control, Deploys National Guard</h2><div class="source-indicator-container"><div class="source-item" data-href="https://www.wlip.com/syndicated-article/?id=1631997"><img class="source-favicon" src="https://www.google.com/s2/favicons?domain=www.wlip.com" alt="Favicon for www.wlip.com"></div><div class="source-item" data-href="https://www.wjnt.com/syndicated-article/?id=1631997"><img class="source-favicon" src="https://www.google.com/s2/favicons?domain=www.wjnt.com" alt="Favicon for www.wjnt.com"></div><div class="source-item" data-href="https://www.madrock1025.com/syndicated-article/?id=1632075"><img class="source-favicon" src="https://www.google.com/s2/favicons?domain=www.madrock1025.com" alt="Favicon for www.madrock1025.com"></div><div class="source-item" data-href="https://www.wjnt.com/syndicated-article/?id=1632075"><img class="source-favicon" src="https://www.google.com/s2/favicons?domain=www.wjnt.com" alt="Favicon for www.wjnt.com"></div></div></div>
<p>President Donald Trump announced a historic measure to address crime and urban conditions in Washington, D.C., declaring a public safety emergency and placing the Metropolitan Police Department under direct federal control. Invoking Section 740 of the District of Columbia Home Rule Act, Trump ordered the deployment of the National Guard and federal law enforcement to restore order and cleanliness in the capital. Attorney General Pam Bondi was named to take command of the police force during this emergency period.</p>
<p>Trump criticized local leadership, particularly Mayor Muriel Bowser, for failing to curb crime and improve the city’s condition, despite official statistics showing a 7% decrease in overall crime, a 26% drop in violent crime, and a 5% reduction in property crime compared to the previous year. The president also called for the removal of homeless encampments from the city center, promising alternative accommodations away from the capital. The federal control of the police will last 30 days unless extended by Congress.</p>
<p>The move has drawn sharp political responses. D.C. Delegate Eleanor Holmes Norton condemned it as an assault on local governance and reiterated the need for D.C. statehood. Congressional Democrats accused Trump of using the takeover as a political distraction, while Republicans praised the action as necessary to make the capital safe again. The operation involves multiple federal agencies with a focus on high-traffic tourist areas and known crime hotspots.</p>

<div class="h2-section-wrapper"><h2>Israeli and U.S. Strikes Severely Damage Iranian Nuclear Facilities</h2><div class="source-indicator-container"><div class="source-item" data-href="https://isis-online.org/isis-reports/post-attack-assessment-of-the-first-12-days-of-israeli-strikes-on-iranian-nuclear-facilities"><img class="source-favicon" src="https://www.google.com/s2/favicons?domain=isis-online.org" alt="Favicon for isis-online.org"></div></div></div>
<p>After 12 days of coordinated military operations, Israeli and U.S. strikes have inflicted significant damage on Iran’s nuclear program, targeting key sites including Natanz, Fordow, Esfahan, Lavisan 2, and the IR-40 Arak Heavy Water Reactor. Satellite imagery and reports from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) confirm destruction and severe damage to uranium enrichment facilities, centrifuge manufacturing sites, uranium conversion plants, and nuclear weapon development centers.</p>
<p>The attacks have effectively crippled Iran’s centrifuge enrichment capabilities and delayed its ability to produce weapon-grade uranium and nuclear weapons. Notably, the Natanz underground enrichment halls suffered from ground-penetrating munitions, and the Fordow site was hit with multiple bunker-buster bombs, likely destroying the deeply buried centrifuge cascades. The Arak reactor’s containment dome was breached, rendering it inoperable and eliminating a plutonium source for weapons.</p>
<p>Despite the extensive damage, residual enriched uranium stocks and some centrifuge components remain, posing ongoing proliferation risks. Israeli intelligence is expected to continue monitoring and targeting these remnants. The current ceasefire provides an opportunity for negotiations to verify Iran’s dismantling of its nuclear and weaponization infrastructure under IAEA supervision. The strikes have also disrupted Iran’s nuclear scientists and weapon development personnel.</p>

<div class="h2-section-wrapper"><h2>Jellyfish Swarm Forces Shutdown of France’s Gravelines Nuclear Power Plant</h2><div class="source-indicator-container"><div class="source-item" data-href="https://993thebuzz.iheart.com/content/2025-08-11-jellyfish-infestation-forces-nuclear-plant-to-shut-down/"><img class="source-favicon" src="https://www.google.com/s2/favicons?domain=993thebuzz.iheart.com" alt="Favicon for 993thebuzz.iheart.com"></div></div></div>
<p>A large swarm of jellyfish caused the automatic shutdown of four reactors at the Gravelines nuclear power plant in northern France on August 10. The jellyfish clogged the filter drums of the plant’s cooling systems, leading to the temporary halt of all six reactors’ operations, as two were already offline for maintenance. Gravelines is one of France’s largest nuclear plants, producing 5.4 gigawatts of power, sufficient for around five million homes.</p>
<p>The event posed no safety risks to personnel, the environment, or the facility. The increase in jellyfish populations is attributed to warming sea temperatures and invasive species such as the Asian Moon jellyfish, effects exacerbated by global climate change that extends jellyfish reproductive seasons. Similar disruptions have been reported at coastal power plants worldwide, including in Scotland, Sweden, the United States, and Japan.</p>
<p>To mitigate future incidents, research institutions like the University of Bristol are developing early warning systems to predict jellyfish swarms that could impact coastal energy infrastructure.</p>

<div class="h2-section-wrapper"><h2>Trump Administration Strikes Revenue-Sharing Deal with Nvidia and AMD for AI Chip Exports to China</h2><div class="source-indicator-container"><div class="source-item" data-href="https://www.madrock1025.com/syndicated-article/?id=1632069"><img class="source-favicon" src="https://www.google.com/s2/favicons?domain=www.madrock1025.com" alt="Favicon for www.madrock1025.com"></div><div class="source-item" data-href="https://www.wjnt.com/syndicated-article/?id=1632069"><img class="source-favicon" src="https://www.google.com/s2/favicons?domain=www.wjnt.com" alt="Favicon for www.wjnt.com"></div><div class="source-item" data-href="https://www.myozarksonline.com/syndicated-article/?id=1632069"><img class="source-favicon" src="https://www.google.com/s2/favicons?domain=www.myozarksonline.com" alt="Favicon for www.myozarksonline.com"></div></div></div>
<p>The Trump administration reached an unprecedented agreement with AI chipmakers Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) allowing the companies to export AI chips to China in exchange for paying the U.S. government 15% of the revenue generated from these sales. This deal grants the companies export licenses to access the Chinese market, despite prior export restrictions initiated under the Biden administration.</p>
<p>Nvidia’s H20 chip and AMD’s MI308 chip, designed for sale in China, are described by U.S. officials as inferior to the best American products, aiming to balance commercial interests with national security concerns. Nvidia confirmed compliance with U.S. government rules but did not comment on the deal’s specifics. AMD has yet to respond publicly.</p>
<p>This revenue-sharing model marks a rare direct financial intervention by the U.S. government in private corporate operations. It follows other recent measures, such as the Trump administration’s “golden share” in U.S. Steel and public calls for Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan’s resignation amid concerns over alleged conflicts of interest related to China.</p>

<div class="h2-section-wrapper"><h2>Five-Year Reflection on the COVID-19 Pandemic’s Global Impact</h2><div class="source-indicator-container"><div class="source-item" data-href="https://www.thereporteronline.com/2025/03/12/pandemic-anniversary-photos/"><img class="source-favicon" src="https://www.google.com/s2/favicons?domain=www.thereporteronline.com" alt="Favicon for www.thereporteronline.com"></div><div class="source-item" data-href="https://www.timesherald.com/2025/03/12/pandemic-anniversary-photos/"><img class="source-favicon" src="https://www.google.com/s2/favicons?domain=www.timesherald.com" alt="Favicon for www.timesherald.com"></div></div></div>
<p>Marking five years since the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic on March 11, 2020, the global community reflects on the far-reaching impact of the novel coronavirus. Initially emerging from China, the virus rapidly spread worldwide, affecting over 114 nations and causing thousands of deaths in the early stages.</p>
<p>The pandemic prompted unprecedented public health responses including widespread mask usage, social distancing measures, and the rapid development and deployment of vaccines such as Pfizer’s COVID-19 vaccine administered globally. Images from around the world document the human experiences during the crisis—from patients receiving care in makeshift tents and hospitals, to soldiers disinfecting public spaces, and the emotional toll on families separated by infection control measures.</p>
<p>The WHO emphasized the need for international cooperation to balance health protection, economic stability, and human rights. Five years on, the pandemic’s legacy continues to influence public health policies, societal behaviors, and global preparedness for future health emergencies.</p>
