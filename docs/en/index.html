<p>Claire's, a retailer specializing in tween accessories, has initiated the liquidation of its stores following its second bankruptcy filing within seven years. The company previously filed for bankruptcy protection in 2018, after which creditors Elliott Management Corporation and Monarch Alternative Capital took over, eliminating $1.9 billion of debt. Despite some sales momentum in 2021, Claire's struggled to modernize its business model, facing challenges in expanding retail partnerships with companies like Walgreens and Walmart, implementing a loyalty program, and investing in influencer-based content.</p>
<p>The company cited ongoing macroeconomic challenges such as higher interest rates, labor costs, and tariffs as factors contributing to its difficulties. Claire’s acknowledged that despite efforts over recent years to address these issues, they were insufficient to overcome the obstacles. This development aligns Claire's with several other major retailers that have filed for bankruptcy in the past decade, including Party City, Z Gallerie, Forever 21, and Rite Aid. Ahead of its bankruptcy filing, Claire's engaged with over 150 potential buyers and received multiple letters of intent, setting a deadline of August 31 for a possible sale.</p>

<p>IsraAid, an Israeli humanitarian organization, has been quietly assisting Palestinians in the Gaza Strip since early 2024, initially acting as an adviser and intermediary to help international aid groups coordinate with Israeli authorities. Recently, IsraAid expanded its role by establishing a logistics hub to facilitate direct aid delivery to Gaza. CEO Yotam Polizer emphasized the complexity of providing humanitarian assistance in Gaza due to the proximity of active fighting and civilian populations, which complicates security and aid distribution.</p>
<p>Polizer detailed the organization's efforts to ensure aid does not fall into the hands of Hamas, including vetting partners, coordinating with the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF), and deconflicting routes and locations for aid delivery. Despite these challenges, IsraAid has helped increase the volume of aid entering Gaza, particularly during ceasefire periods, and works closely with a range of stakeholders including the UN, NGOs, and Gulf countries. Polizer warned that Gaza is approaching an extreme humanitarian situation, with urgent needs for food, medical support, and hygiene supplies, especially for vulnerable groups like orphans, the elderly, and disabled individuals.</p>
<p>He also noted a recent shift in public acknowledgment of the crisis within Israel and the Jewish community, with greater readiness to support humanitarian efforts. IsraAid plans to maintain a long-term commitment to Gaza’s recovery, drawing on its experience in other conflict zones. The organization continues to work with Israeli communities affected by Hamas attacks, balancing aid efforts on both sides of the conflict.</p>

<div class="h2-section-wrapper"><h2>Bangladesh’s Foreign Policy Shifts Amid Strained Relations with India</h2><div class="source-indicator-container"><div class="source-item" data-href="https://frontline.thehindu.com/world-affairs/india-bangladesh-relations-diplomatic-shift/article69920139.ece"><img class="source-favicon" src="https://www.google.com/s2/favicons?domain=frontline.thehindu.com" alt="Favicon for frontline.thehindu.com"></div></div></div>
<p>One year after the ouster of former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, Bangladesh has undergone significant foreign policy changes that have strained its traditionally close relationship with India. Bangladesh has invited China to establish a Special Economic Zone and to engage in trade with India’s northeastern region, including building an airport near the strategic Siliguri corridor. These moves represent a 180-degree turn from previous policies and have led to suspensions by India of visa programs and certain trade facilities affecting Bangladesh.</p>
<p>Veteran Bangladeshi diplomat M. Humayun Kabir explained that Bangladesh views its engagement with China as part of a broader strategy to diversify economic partnerships, noting that China is Bangladesh’s largest import source and infrastructure partner. He emphasized that Bangladesh seeks to maintain a normal and pragmatic relationship with India based on dignity and equality but expressed concern that India has not fully appreciated the changes in Bangladesh’s government and policies.</p>
<p>Kabir also addressed regional dynamics, including recent trilateral meetings involving Pakistan, China, and Bangladesh, which he characterized as exploratory rather than forming a structured alliance. The diplomat acknowledged ongoing challenges within Bangladesh, including political violence and institutional rebuilding following a period of unrest. He underscored the importance of addressing minority protections and historical grievances as part of normalizing relations with India.</p>

<div class="h2-section-wrapper"><h2>Everton Advances in Transfer Market, Nearing Deal for Jack Grealish</h2><div class="source-indicator-container"><div class="source-item" data-href="https://toffeeweb.com/season/24-25/rumour-mill/46511.html"><img class="source-favicon" src="https://www.google.com/s2/favicons?domain=toffeeweb.com" alt="Favicon for toffeeweb.com"></div></div></div>
<p>English Premier League club Everton has intensified efforts to sign midfielder Jack Grealish from Manchester City, with reports indicating that terms have been agreed between the clubs and the player is set to undergo a medical. Everton aims to make Grealish a key signing of the summer transfer window, offering him regular playing time to revive his career ahead of the upcoming World Cup.</p>
<p>Grealish, who joined Manchester City in 2021 for a British transfer record fee of £100 million, has struggled for consistent playing time under Pep Guardiola in recent seasons. Everton is reportedly prepared to pay a significant portion of his £300,000-a-week wages on a season-long loan deal. The club is also pursuing Southampton winger Tyler Dibling, though negotiations have been protracted due to a valuation gap between the clubs.</p>
<p>Fans and commentators have expressed mixed reactions, weighing Grealish’s potential impact against his wage demands and fit within the squad. Everton’s recruitment strategy focuses on bolstering creativity and attacking options, addressing weaknesses exposed in recent performances. The club has already signed several players this summer and is looking to complete further key acquisitions before the season commences.</p>
