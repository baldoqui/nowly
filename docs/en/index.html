<p>Following President Donald Trump’s unprecedented decision to federalize the Washington, D.C., police department and deploy 800 National Guard troops for at least a month, a significant escalation in law enforcement presence has been reported across the city. The White House announced that over 1,650 personnel from various federal and local agencies are now actively participating in round-the-clock operations targeting specific criminal hotspots, including gang members, drug dealers, and high-crime areas.</p>
<p>On the first night of intensified operations, authorities made 45 arrests, among which 29 were individuals living in the country illegally. Charges included drug distribution or possession, carrying concealed weapons, and assaulting federal officers. The National Guard, while assisting in security and patrol duties such as monument protection and traffic control, are not authorized to make arrests but may temporarily detain individuals who breach restricted areas.</p>
<p>The federalization initiative also involves clearing homeless encampments throughout the city, with plans to relocate displaced individuals to shelters or provide addiction and mental health services. However, details on the relocation process and long-term support remain unclear. Advocacy groups have expressed concern about the adequacy of shelter capacity and the potential for increased arrests among unhoused populations. The city government has undertaken some encampment closures independently, aiming to provide stronger social services during the process.</p>
<p>Mayor Muriel Bowser, a Democrat, has criticized the federal takeover as an "authoritarian push" but also acknowledged the potential public safety benefits. The unusual command structure has raised questions about jurisdiction and control, with the White House stating that Attorney General Pam Bondi is effectively in charge of the police department, while the city’s police chief, Pamela Smith, maintains she reports only to the mayor.</p>

<p>President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin are scheduled to meet at Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson outside Anchorage, Alaska, in what is being described as a pivotal summit. This marks Putin’s first visit to the United States since 2015. The summit aims to address the ongoing conflict in Ukraine and broader bilateral issues, including nuclear arms control.</p>
<p>Trump expressed cautious optimism, stating there is a 25% chance the meeting could fail but floated the possibility of inviting Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy for a subsequent trilateral discussion if the initial talks prove successful. However, Zelenskyy and European leaders have voiced concerns that the summit could marginalize Ukraine’s interests, warning that decisions made without Kyiv’s participation would be ineffective and potentially harmful.</p>
<p>Russian officials seek international recognition of their annexation of Crimea and other occupied regions, demands firmly rejected by Ukraine, which insists on retaining its territorial integrity. The summit’s agenda also includes discussions on sanctions against Russia, with Trump threatening severe consequences should Putin fail to agree to a ceasefire.</p>
<p>European leaders, including U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer and French President Emmanuel Macron, have expressed cautious support for the talks but emphasize the necessity of protecting Ukraine’s sovereignty. Analysts warn that Putin may use the summit to pressure the U.S. into concessions favorable to Russia, potentially undermining Ukraine and NATO.</p>

<p>In a U.S.-brokered agreement signed in Washington, Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan and Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev pledged to reopen transport and communication links between their countries, aiming to normalize diplomatic relations and end hostilities. The centerpiece of the deal is a 43-kilometer transport corridor through Armenia’s Syunik Province, connecting mainland Azerbaijan to its Nakhchivan exclave. The corridor, dubbed the “Trump Route for International Peace and Prosperity,” will be operated by a private American company on a 99-year lease.</p>
<p>The agreement is hailed by supporters as a potential economic boon, promising increased trade, job creation, and regional stability. Turkey, Azerbaijan’s close ally, views the corridor as a strategic link uniting Turkic states from Central Asia to Europe. The United States sees the corridor as a means to secure energy routes and extend geopolitical influence in a region traditionally dominated by Russia.</p>
<p>However, the deal has sparked significant controversy. Armenia faces internal opposition due to territorial concessions and demands from Azerbaijan to revise Armenia’s constitution to renounce claims to Azerbaijani lands. Azerbaijan’s leadership maintains maximalist territorial claims, and military spending has surged, signaling possible future escalations. Russia and Iran have expressed concerns over the corridor’s impact on regional balance and sovereignty.</p>
<p>Observers caution that the agreement’s vague guarantees and the involvement of a private American company in managing the corridor could undermine Armenia’s control over its territory. The corridor is viewed less as a peace project and more as a geopolitical flashpoint involving competing interests of Baku, Ankara, Washington, Moscow, and Tehran.</p>

<p>Following President Trump’s threats to federalize police forces and deploy National Guard troops in major liberal-leaning U.S. cities such as Chicago, Los Angeles, New York, Baltimore, and Oakland, mayors of these cities—who are predominantly Black Democrats—have publicly pushed back. They emphasize that violent crime rates in their cities have reached historic lows or are significantly declining, contrary to the president’s claims of “out of control” crime.</p>
<p>Baltimore Mayor Brandon Scott highlighted a 28% drop in homicides this year, the lowest in over 50 years. Oakland’s Mayor Barbara Lee reported a 28% overall crime reduction, while Los Angeles is on track for its lowest homicide total in nearly six decades. Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson noted a 15% crime decrease compared to the previous year and criticized Trump for cutting funding to violence prevention programs.</p>
<p>Legal experts assert that Trump lacks the authority to federalize local law enforcement outside of Washington, D.C., which has unique federal oversight. Civil rights groups warn that the federal takeover of D.C. could serve as a test case for authoritarian control nationwide. Mayors call for federal cooperation focused on violence prevention, gun control legislation, and addressing trafficking, rather than militarized interventions.</p>
<p>The White House characterized the targeted cities as among the most dangerous in America and accused their leaders of failing to address crime effectively.</p>

<div class="h2-section-wrapper"><h2>Historic Context: Alaska’s Legacy as Former Russian Territory</h2><div class="source-indicator-container"><div class="source-item" data-href="http://www.bignewsnetwork.com/news/278510357/alaska-before-it-was-americas-last-frontier-it-was-russias-first"><img class="source-favicon" src="https://www.google.com/s2/favicons?domain=www.bignewsnetwork.com" alt="Favicon for www.bignewsnetwork.com"></div><div class="source-item" data-href="http://www.nepalnational.com/news/278510357/alaska-before-it-was-americas-last-frontier-it-was-russias-first"><img class="source-favicon" src="https://www.google.com/s2/favicons?domain=www.nepalnational.com" alt="Favicon for www.nepalnational.com"></div><div class="source-item" data-href="http://www.asiabulletin.com/news/278510357/alaska-before-it-was-americas-last-frontier-it-was-russias-first"><img class="source-favicon" src="https://www.google.com/s2/favicons?domain=www.asiabulletin.com" alt="Favicon for www.asiabulletin.com"></div></div></div>
<p>As Presidents Trump and Putin prepare to meet in Alaska, the choice of location carries deep historical symbolism. Alaska was Russia’s only significant overseas possession, known as Russian America, before being sold to the United States in 1867 for $7.2 million.</p>
<p>Russian exploration of Alaska began in the early 18th century, driven by the fur trade and economic interests. Settlements were established along the Alaskan coast, including Kodiak Island and Sitka, often encountering resistance from indigenous groups such as the Tlingit, leading to violent clashes in the early 1800s. Despite hardships and limited population—never exceeding approximately 1,000 Russian settlers—Russian influence persisted, including through Orthodox Christian missions.</p>
<p>Economic challenges, including depleted sea otter populations and the high cost of maintaining the remote colony, motivated the sale. The funds from the sale were used to develop infrastructure in Russia, such as railway construction.</p>
<p>The legacy of Russian America remains culturally significant in both Russia and Alaska, symbolizing a complex history of exploration, conflict, and cultural exchange.</p>
