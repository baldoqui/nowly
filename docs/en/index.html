<p>In a highly symbolic summit in Alaska, Russian President Vladimir Putin made his first visit to the United States in a decade, receiving a warm welcome from U.S. President Donald Trump. The meeting featured red carpet treatment, handshakes, and a military flyover by a B-2 stealth bomber, signaling a show of power and cordiality. Trump praised the relationship, referring to Russia as a “big power … No. 2 in the world,” though he acknowledged no agreement was reached to end the ongoing war in Ukraine.</p>
<p>The hastily arranged summit did not produce a ceasefire deal, with Trump shifting focus from a temporary truce to pursuing a comprehensive “Peace Agreement,” echoing Kremlin positions. Russian demands remain non-negotiable for Ukraine, including ceding partially occupied regions and renouncing NATO aspirations. Observers noted that the summit largely favored Putin, who effectively stalled pressure to end the conflict. Despite threats of “severe consequences” for Moscow, no immediate punitive actions materialized. Russian forces continue to make incremental territorial gains in Ukraine, signaling ongoing hostilities.</p>
<p>Experts described the summit as a diplomatic victory for Putin, marking his return from international isolation. Trump’s approach reflects a more assertive stance compared to his previous term, emboldened by a perceived mandate from the 2024 election. The meeting sets the stage for further discussions, including an upcoming White House meeting between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. However, skepticism remains about the prospects for peace given the entrenched positions and continuing battlefield violence.</p>

<p>The Milwaukee Brewers continued their remarkable season with a dramatic 10-8 comeback victory over the Cincinnati Reds, marking their 13th straight win and tying the franchise record set in 1987. Christian Yelich was instrumental, hitting two home runs and driving in five runs during a four-hit performance. The Brewers overcame an early seven-run deficit, showcasing resilience and strong bullpen performance to secure the win.</p>
<p>This winning streak has propelled Milwaukee to a 77-44 record, the best in Major League Baseball, with the team outscoring opponents 36-13 over the last three games. Despite struggles from starting pitcher Jacob Misiorowski, the Brewers’ offense and bullpen combined to halt the Reds’ momentum after a dominant second inning.</p>
<p>Other notable MLB results included the Pittsburgh Pirates defeating the Chicago Cubs 3-2 with a ninth-inning home run by Jack Suwinski, and the Detroit Tigers blanking the Minnesota Twins 7-0 behind strong pitching from Charlie Morton. The Seattle Mariners rallied to an 11-9 win over the New York Mets, with Cal Raleigh hitting his league-leading 46th home run and becoming the first player this season with 100 RBIs.</p>

<div class="h2-section-wrapper"><h2>Malnourished Palestinian Woman Dies in Italy Amid Gaza Humanitarian Crisis</h2><div class="source-indicator-container"><div class="source-item" data-href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-15006759/Malnourished-Palestinian-woman-20-evacuated-Gaza-dies-Italian-hospital.html"><img class="source-favicon" src="https://www.google.com/s2/favicons?domain=www.dailymail.co.uk" alt="Favicon for www.dailymail.co.uk"></div></div></div>
<p>A 20-year-old Palestinian woman, Marah Abu Zuhri, evacuated from Gaza due to severe malnutrition, has died in an Italian hospital in Pisa. She was admitted in a critical state described as “profound organic wasting” and succumbed after respiratory failure and cardiac arrest. The evacuation was part of a humanitarian mission involving several flights bringing critically ill Gazans to Italy for treatment.</p>
<p>This tragedy highlights the worsening humanitarian situation in Gaza amid ongoing conflict. UN experts have warned of widespread famine and malnutrition, particularly among children under five, with thousands suffering acute malnutrition. Despite these warnings, Israel denies that Gaza is facing starvation, attributing aid shortages to Hamas’ interference.</p>
<p>International calls for action to alleviate the crisis have intensified, with several countries urging immediate and sustained aid access to Gaza. The situation remains dire, with reports of hundreds of Palestinians killed while seeking aid and severe shortages of food and medicine continuing to affect the population.</p>

Police, Faces Legal and Political Pushback</h2><div class="source-indicator-container"><div class="source-item" data-href="https://wtop.com/dc/2025/08/weekly-breakdown-what-are-federal-forces-doing-in-dc/"><img class="source-favicon" src="https://www.google.com/s2/favicons?domain=wtop.com" alt="Favicon for wtop.com"></div><div class="source-item" data-href="https://edition.cnn.com/2025/08/16/politics/trump-washington-dc-kennedy-center-police"><img class="source-favicon" src="https://www.google.com/s2/favicons?domain=edition.cnn.com" alt="Favicon for edition.cnn.com"></div></div></div>
<p>Following an executive order by President Donald Trump to federalize the Washington D.C. Metropolitan Police Department and deploy 800 National Guard troops, the city has experienced a significant federal law enforcement presence. The move, justified by Trump as a response to a “public safety emergency” and aimed at addressing crime and city beautification, has sparked controversy and resistance.</p>
<p>D.C. officials, including Mayor Muriel Bowser and Attorney General Brian Schwalb, have challenged the legality of the federal takeover, arguing it violates the Home Rule Act that grants the city limited autonomy. A federal judge ruled that the administration lacks authority to replace the D.C. Police Chief, affirming local control over the police department.</p>
<p>The federal presence has included clearing homeless encampments and increased patrols by National Guard and federal agents. The Justice Department appointed Terry Cole as interim federal administrator for the police department, a move opposed by city leadership. The situation remains tense, with ongoing legal challenges and political disputes about jurisdiction and the appropriate role of federal forces in the capital.</p>

<div class="h2-section-wrapper"><h2>South Asian Diaspora Navigates Identity and Community in Norway</h2><div class="source-indicator-container"><div class="source-item" data-href="https://indiacurrents.com/biryani-or-pizza-a-tale-of-southasians-in-norway/"><img class="source-favicon" src="https://www.google.com/s2/favicons?domain=indiacurrents.com" alt="Favicon for indiacurrents.com"></div></div></div>
<p>An exploration of the South Asian diaspora in Norway reveals a complex interplay of cultural identity, integration, and community building. South Asians, including migrants from India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, and Nepal, have established a presence in Norway since the 1970s, with varying degrees of visibility and cohesion.</p>
<p>While shared languages such as Urdu, Hindi, and Punjabi create some cultural bonds, South Asians in Norway often maintain distinct community identities, organizing festivals like the Mela Festival and Eid celebrations. Challenges persist, including social integration barriers, discrimination, and the persistence of caste dynamics within diaspora communities.</p>
<p>Notable individuals of South Asian origin have contributed to Norwegian society in politics, arts, and activism, highlighting the evolving nature of identity among first-generation immigrants and their descendants. The diaspora’s ongoing negotiation of belonging reflects broader themes of multiculturalism and social inclusion in Scandinavian societies.</p>
