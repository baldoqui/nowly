<p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced a plan to intensify the 22-month conflict with Hamas by taking control of Gaza City, a move that has sparked widespread concern among Palestinians, Israelis, and global leaders. Large parts of Gaza City have already been devastated by prior bombardments and ground incursions, and a major ground operation is expected to cause further mass displacement and exacerbate the ongoing humanitarian crisis.  </p>
<p>Palestinians in Gaza City expressed resignation and defiance, with many stating they have no intention to leave their homes despite the destruction and scarcity of essentials like drinking water. Israeli families of hostages held in Gaza voiced fears that the operation could endanger those captives. Former Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and other security officials warned that the costs of such an operation might outweigh any achievable objectives. Hamas has rejected Israel’s plans, warning that the incursion "will not be a walk in the park."  </p>
<p>The international community has responded with criticism and calls for restraint. Germany announced a suspension of military equipment exports that could be used in Gaza, while countries including France, the United Kingdom, Canada, Saudi Arabia, Pakistan, Spain, Turkey, and Australia condemned the planned operation, urging Israel to reconsider and pursue a ceasefire and negotiations for a two-state solution. The United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres described the decision as a "dangerous escalation," warning it risks deepening the catastrophic consequences for millions of Palestinians and endangering lives, including those of remaining hostages.  </p>
<p>Efforts by mediators from Egypt and Qatar are underway to draft a framework for ending the war and securing the release of all hostages in exchange for an Israeli withdrawal from Gaza. The plan includes provisions for a Palestinian-Arab committee to oversee Gaza’s administration and reconstruction, although details and the role of the Palestinian Authority remain unclear. The UN Security Council has scheduled an emergency meeting to discuss Israel’s plans, following a request supported by multiple member states but opposed by the United States.  </p>

<div class="h2-section-wrapper"><h2>Germany Imposes Partial Arms Embargo on Israel Over Gaza City Plan</h2><div class="source-indicator-container"><div class="source-item" data-href="https://legalinsurrection.com/2025/08/germany-imposes-partial-arms-embargo-on-israel-over-plan-to-capture-gaza-city/"><img class="source-favicon" src="https://www.google.com/s2/favicons?domain=legalinsurrection.com" alt="Favicon for legalinsurrection.com"></div><div class="source-item" data-href="https://www.wlky.com/article/israels-plan-to-take-gaza-city-reactions-from-palestinians-israelis-world-leaders/65643510"><img class="source-favicon" src="https://www.google.com/s2/favicons?domain=www.wlky.com" alt="Favicon for www.wlky.com"></div></div></div>
<p>In response to Israel’s decision to take control of Gaza City, Germany announced a partial arms embargo, suspending exports of military equipment that could be used in Gaza. Chancellor Friedrich Merz emphasized that while Israel has the right to defend itself against Hamas terrorism, the escalation of military action complicates the prospects for releasing hostages and achieving a ceasefire. He called on Israel to facilitate humanitarian aid access and urged against further steps toward annexation of the West Bank.  </p>
<p>The embargo marks a significant shift in Germany’s traditionally strong support for Israel, as it is the country’s second-largest arms supplier after the United States. The German government’s decision has been met with sharp criticism from Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu, who accused Germany of “rewarding Hamas terrorism.” Netanyahu reiterated Israel’s objective to free Gaza from Hamas and establish a peaceful civilian administration, not to conquer the territory.  </p>
<p>Other European countries and international leaders have also voiced criticism of Israel’s plans, warning of the potential to worsen the humanitarian crisis in Gaza and calling for diplomatic solutions to end the conflict. Meanwhile, the Israel Defense Forces continue targeted operations against Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad commanders in Gaza and have conducted an airstrike eliminating a senior Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP) terrorist operative in Syria.  </p>

<p>Chinese scientists are conducting extensive research and conservation efforts along the Chishui River, the only major free-flowing tributary in the upper Yangtze River, to restore the ecology of China’s longest river. The Chishui River serves as a sanctuary and breeding ground for over 160 fish species, including more than 40 rare and endemic species.  </p>
<p>A decade-long fishing ban implemented in 2017 on the Chishui River has led to significant improvements, including a near tripling of catch per unit effort, increased biomass, and the return of several rare species such as the Yangtze sturgeon and eel. In addition, a dam removal campaign has dismantled over 320 small dams on tributaries, restoring habitats and improving river connectivity. Natural breeding experiments have successfully resulted in the spawning and hatching of Yangtze sturgeon after more than two decades without natural reproduction.  </p>
<p>These localized conservation successes underpin broader restoration strategies for the Yangtze River, where ecological deterioration has led to the functional extinction of species like the Baiji dolphin and Chinese paddlefish. The Yangtze finless porpoise, considered an ecological barometer of the river, has shown signs of recovery following integrated conservation efforts, including ex-situ breeding and rewilding programs. China’s model for cetacean conservation is gaining international recognition and offers insights for protecting endangered species in other regions.  </p>
