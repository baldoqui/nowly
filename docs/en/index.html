<div class="h2-section-wrapper"><h2>Armenia and Azerbaijan Sign Historic Peace Declaration at White House</h2><div class="source-indicator-container"><div class="source-item" data-href="https://www.westhawaiitoday.com/2025/08/09/nation-world-news/leaders-of-armenia-and-azerbaijan-sign-peace-pledge-at-white-house/"><img class="source-favicon" src="https://www.google.com/s2/favicons?domain=www.westhawaiitoday.com" alt="Favicon for www.westhawaiitoday.com"></div><div class="source-item" data-href="https://www.azernews.az/analysis/245802.html"><img class="source-favicon" src="https://www.google.com/s2/favicons?domain=www.azernews.az" alt="Favicon for www.azernews.az"></div><div class="source-item" data-href="https://www.thenationalnews.com/news/mena/2025/08/09/syrian-government-pulls-out-of-paris-talks-with-kurds-after-minorities-call-for-federal-system/"><img class="source-favicon" src="https://www.google.com/s2/favicons?domain=www.thenationalnews.com" alt="Favicon for www.thenationalnews.com"></div></div></div>
<p>Leaders of Armenia and Azerbaijan, Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan and President Ilham Aliyev, signed a joint declaration at the White House on August 8, 2025, marking a significant step towards resolving their decades-long conflict. The agreement includes the establishment of a 27-mile transit corridor through Armenian territory, connecting Azerbaijan to its Nakhchivan exclave, named the "Trump Route for International Peace and Prosperity." This corridor runs along Armenia’s southern border with Iran and is set to facilitate trade and connectivity in the South Caucasus region.</p>
<p>The declaration enshrines principles such as respect for borders, renunciation of territorial claims, and rejection of force, aiming to foster peace, prosperity, and economic cooperation. The agreement also calls for the dissolution of the Minsk Group, a long-standing mediation body, and includes Armenia’s commitment to constitutional reforms removing territorial claims against Azerbaijan. Both leaders praised U.S. President Donald Trump for his mediation role, with Aliyev and Pashinyan endorsing him for the Nobel Peace Prize.</p>
<p>While the declaration marks a diplomatic breakthrough, it does not resolve all disputes, including sovereignty claims over Nagorno-Karabakh or border delineations. The corridor’s creation has already drawn concerns from Iran, wary of U.S. influence near its border, and from Armenian diaspora groups fearing erosion of Armenia’s sovereignty. The agreement is seen as a geopolitical shift, enhancing U.S. and Turkish influence in the region while curtailing Russia’s traditional sway.</p>

<p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy publicly dismissed the planned summit between U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin, scheduled for August 15, 2025, in Alaska. Zelenskyy warned that any peace deal negotiated without Kyiv’s participation would be “dead solutions” that would not bring lasting peace. He emphasized Ukraine’s constitutional territorial integrity as non-negotiable and insisted that Ukraine’s voice must be present at the negotiation table.</p>
<p>The summit, viewed as a potential breakthrough in the over three-year conflict following Russia’s 2022 invasion of Ukraine, has raised concerns that Ukraine could be sidelined. Trump indicated that the meeting with Putin would precede any direct talks with Zelenskyy and suggested that territorial swaps might be part of a peace agreement, without providing specifics. Analysts note that Russia and Ukraine remain far apart on peace terms.</p>
<p>The Kremlin confirmed Putin’s readiness to meet in Alaska, with Russian foreign affairs adviser Yuri Ushakov calling the summit logical. However, Zelenskyy’s firm stance underscores Kyiv’s refusal to cede territory or accept a peace deal excluding its input. Meanwhile, fighting continues on the ground, with recent drone attacks causing casualties in Ukrainian cities.</p>

<p>Germany announced a suspension of arms exports to Israel that could be used in the Gaza Strip, a significant policy shift reflecting growing public and political concern over Israel’s military actions in Gaza and plans to expand control over the enclave. Chancellor Friedrich Merz, previously a staunch supporter of Israel, cited that Israel’s ongoing military campaign would not achieve its goals and expressed that the move was a “warning shot” rather than a full policy reversal.</p>
<p>The decision follows widespread international condemnation of Israel’s plan to seize Gaza City and forcibly displace nearly one million Palestinians to southern concentration zones, which has sparked fears of a humanitarian catastrophe. Public opinion in Germany has shifted, with 66% of Germans calling for more pressure on Israel to change its behavior amid images of widespread destruction and civilian suffering.</p>
<p>The suspension specifically targets military equipment that could be used in Gaza and is part of a broader debate within Germany about balancing historical responsibilities with current geopolitical realities. The move has drawn mixed reactions domestically, with some media criticizing the government’s stance and others warning of rising anti-Israel sentiment.</p>

<div class="h2-section-wrapper"><h2>Palestine Action Protesters Clash with Police in London Amid Mass Arrests</h2><div class="source-indicator-container"><div class="source-item" data-href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14985193/Palestine-Action-supporters-mass-Parliament-Square.html"><img class="source-favicon" src="https://www.google.com/s2/favicons?domain=www.dailymail.co.uk" alt="Favicon for www.dailymail.co.uk"></div></div></div>
<p>In London’s Parliament Square, supporters of the proscribed group Palestine Action staged a large demonstration, leading to a significant police operation with hundreds of officers and over 50 arrests reported by mid-afternoon on August 9, 2025. The Metropolitan Police have warned that any expression of support for Palestine Action, banned under the Terrorism Act 2000, will result in arrest. The group was banned following attacks on military aircraft at RAF Brize Norton.</p>
<p>Protesters displayed a range of messages, including calls against genocide and for the right to non-violent protest. The demonstration occurred alongside other protests across the UK related to migrant issues and far-right counter-demonstrations, prompting concerns about public order and safety. Police have imposed strict conditions on related marches and have drawn officers from other forces to manage the expected busy weekend.</p>
<p>The protests reflect ongoing tensions over the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and domestic debates on immigration and free speech. Palestine Action has received permission to challenge its ban in court, with protests continuing until a judicial review scheduled for November.</p>

Reports Strong Q2 Momentum in Uranium and Rare Earths Production</h2><div class="source-indicator-container"><div class="source-item" data-href="https://www.insidermonkey.com/blog/energy-fuels-inc-amexuuuu-q2-2025-earnings-call-transcript-1587323/"><img class="source-favicon" src="https://www.google.com/s2/favicons?domain=www.insidermonkey.com" alt="Favicon for www.insidermonkey.com"></div></div></div>
<p>Energy Fuels Inc., a U.S.-based critical minerals company, reported progress in the second quarter of 2025, highlighting rapid advancement in uranium production and rare earth element (REE) separations. The company mined over 660,000 pounds of uranium in the quarter, projecting an annualized rate exceeding 2 million pounds. Costs for processing uranium from the Pinyon Plain mine are expected to be exceptionally low, between $23 and $30 per pound, positioning Energy Fuels competitively in the global market.</p>
<p>Energy Fuels is also expanding its rare earths processing capabilities at the White Mesa Mill, with phase 2 feasibility studies underway to increase monazite processing capacity to Lynas scale. The company is piloting production of heavy rare earth oxides such as dysprosium and terbium, with plans for commercial production by 2026. The Donald project in Australia and Toliara project in Madagascar are advancing towards final investment decisions.</p>
<p>Financially, Energy Fuels reported a net loss of $22 million for Q2, attributed to strategic decisions to withhold uranium sales amid low prices and investments in project development. The company maintains a strong balance sheet with over $250 million in liquidity and no debt, and is actively pursuing long-term uranium sales contracts.</p>

<div class="h2-section-wrapper"><h2>Monster Beverage Corporation Posts Record Q2 Sales Amid Global Energy Drink Growth</h2><div class="source-indicator-container"><div class="source-item" data-href="https://www.insidermonkey.com/blog/monster-beverage-corporation-nasdaqmnst-q2-2025-earnings-call-transcript-1587340/"><img class="source-favicon" src="https://www.google.com/s2/favicons?domain=www.insidermonkey.com" alt="Favicon for www.insidermonkey.com"></div></div></div>
<p>Monster Beverage Corporation announced record net sales of $2.11 billion for the second quarter of 2025, an 11.1% increase compared to the same period in 2024. The company’s growth is driven by strong performance in the global energy drink category, with household penetration increasing across regions including the United States, Europe, Asia Pacific, and Latin America.</p>
<p>Key highlights include successful sponsorships such as the McLaren Formula 1 team and UFC events, and new product launches like Monster Energy Lando Norris Zero Sugar in select EMEA markets. The company plans further innovation with new flavor introductions and marketing campaigns to enhance brand visibility, particularly for its Ultra brand family.</p>
<p>While tariffs have had an immaterial impact in Q2, modest effects are expected in Q3, with selective price adjustments under discussion for Q4. Monster’s gross profit margin improved primarily due to pricing actions and supply chain optimizations. The company continues to expand internationally, with net sales outside the U.S. comprising approximately 41% of total sales.</p>
