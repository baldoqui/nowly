<p>Russian President Vladimir Putin and former U.S. President Donald Trump are scheduled to meet in Alaska this Friday to discuss ending the ongoing war in Ukraine. The summit has sparked apprehension among Ukraine and European leaders, who insist that Kyiv must be an active participant in any negotiations. Trump suggested that the peace deal could involve "some swapping of territories" to the benefit of both Russia and Ukraine, a proposal strongly rejected by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.</p>
<p>Ukraine maintains a firm stance against ceding any land to Russia and insists on its right to join NATO and host Western troops. Russia, meanwhile, demands recognition of its annexations of Crimea and four Ukrainian regions, a neutral status for Ukraine, and restrictions on its military capabilities and alliances. European leaders have called for increased pressure on Russia and emphasized that peace talks must protect Ukraine’s sovereignty and security interests. National security advisors from Ukraine’s allies are coordinating their approach ahead of the summit, underscoring the importance of Ukraine’s involvement in any peace process.</p>
<p>The summit marks the first meeting between sitting U.S. and Russian presidents since 2021, amid ongoing hostilities characterized by intense fighting and missile and drone attacks. Observers warn that Putin may use the meeting to coerce Ukraine into an unfavorable agreement, while Zelenskyy continues to push for a comprehensive and dignified peace. The likelihood of a breakthrough remains uncertain, with analysts predicting the conflict may persist in cycles of open warfare and simmering tension.</p>

<p>The Greek island of Lesbos is experiencing a surge in visitors from Turkey this summer, with thousands of Turkish tourists arriving via new and existing ferry connections. Visitors from cities such as Izmir, Ayvalik, and Istanbul are flocking to Lesbos' coastal towns, enjoying local cuisine, beaches, and cultural attractions. The island offers a more relaxed atmosphere compared to Turkish resorts, with affordable prices attracting middle-class Turkish families.</p>
<p>This increase in tourism is fostering improved relations between Greece and Turkey, historically marked by conflict and territorial disputes. Despite ongoing tensions over maritime borders, airspace, and the establishment of marine parks, local residents and tourists are embracing cross-border exchanges as a means of promoting goodwill. Officials from both countries emphasize the importance of tourism and cooperation on migration issues as pillars of their bilateral relationship, even as political disputes persist at higher levels.</p>
<p>The new ferry route between Mytilene and Ayvalik, inaugurated recently, is expected to further boost tourism and trade, strengthening people-to-people connections. In 2024, around 120,000 people traveled between Turkey and Lesbos by boat, with expectations for even greater numbers this year.</p>

<p>Two years into his presidency, Nigerian President Bola Tinubu faces political debate over his administration’s treatment of the Northern region regarding political appointments and infrastructure development. Northern governors, ministers, and officials convened in Kaduna to present achievements and reject allegations of marginalization. They highlighted significant federal investments in the North, including major infrastructure projects such as the Abuja–Kano Expressway dualization, Sokoto–Badagry Superhighway, Kano–Maradi Standard Gauge Railway, power transmission lines, inland dry ports, and airport expansions.</p>
<p>Budget Office Director-General Dr. Tanimu Yakubu confirmed that over 50% of the 2024 and 2025 capital budgets are allocated to Northern projects. Critics accusing the government of neglect are seen as pursuing self-serving political interests ahead of the 2027 elections. The administration emphasizes inclusivity, security improvements, and economic reforms. Northern leaders were urged to reflect on their own roles in regional development. While acknowledging room for improvement, officials assert that President Tinubu has largely kept faith with his promises to the North.</p>
