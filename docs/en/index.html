<p>Following a high-stakes summit in Alaska, former U.S. President Donald Trump expressed support for Russian President Vladimir Putin’s demand that Ukraine surrender control of the Donbas region, specifically the Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts, to Russia as a precondition for peace. Putin proposed that if Ukraine agreed to withdraw from these key eastern territories, Russia would freeze the front lines elsewhere and refrain from further territorial advances. Trump indicated that ceding land, while controversial, is part of the price for peace and the quickest way to end the war.</p>
<p>The United States has offered Ukraine “Article 5-style” security guarantees akin to NATO’s mutual defense clause, obliging allies to respond to any future Russian aggression, though Ukraine would not become a NATO member. European leaders remain cautious, emphasizing that any territorial concessions must be decided by Kyiv. Trump plans to meet Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in Washington to discuss the proposal, with European coalition leaders preparing for talks to support Ukraine while managing relations with Trump. Despite Putin’s partial occupation claims and territorial ambitions, including Crimea, the Kremlin’s willingness to negotiate remains limited.</p>

<p>Catastrophic monsoon rains and flash floods have devastated northern Pakistan, particularly in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP), where the death toll has surged to 340. The National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) reported 312 deaths in KP districts in the last 48 hours, with additional casualties in Gilgit-Baltistan (GB) and Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK). Since the monsoon season began in late June, the cumulative death toll has reached 645, with KP being the worst affected province.</p>
<p>Rescue operations involving boats, helicopters, and army personnel are ongoing to save stranded residents and tourists, amid severe damage to infrastructure including highways, bridges, and power plants. The KP government has declared a state of emergency in flood-affected districts until August 31, releasing significant funds for relief and restoration. The Pakistan Meteorological Department forecasts continued heavy rains until August 21, prompting travel advisories and calls for public caution. The government, military, and humanitarian agencies are mobilizing resources to provide immediate aid and support recovery efforts.</p>

<p>Los Angeles has officially designated three sites as Historic-Cultural Monuments to honor African American heritage in the city. The newly recognized landmarks include the Tom &amp; Ethel Bradley Residence, St. Elmo Village, and Jewel’s Catch One nightclub. These designations are part of the African American Historic Places Los Angeles initiative (AAHPLA), a partnership launched in 2022 between the Getty Conservation Institute and the City of Los Angeles to address underrepresentation in historic preservation.</p>
<p>The Bradley Residence was home to Tom Bradley, Los Angeles’s first Black mayor, and his wife Ethel, serving as a political and community hub during a period of racial segregation. St. Elmo Village is a cultural enclave founded by Black artists and activists, while Jewel’s Catch One is a pioneering nightclub known for its role as a safe space for Black and LGBTQ+ communities. The initiative aims to preserve and celebrate sites of cultural and social significance that have traditionally been overlooked in landmark programs.</p>

<p>The Alaska summit between Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin marked the Russian leader’s first visit to the United States in a decade and his first to a Western country since the 2022 invasion of Ukraine. Putin received a red carpet welcome, including applause from Trump and a U.S. military flyover, signaling a significant rehabilitation of his international status. The summit concluded without a concrete peace deal, but Trump praised the relationship and indicated a shift away from demanding a ceasefire toward pursuing a comprehensive peace agreement, aligning with Russia’s long-standing position.</p>
<p>Critics described the summit as a diplomatic victory for Putin, who succeeded in stalling pressure to end the war and gaining time for further military advances. Despite sanctions and an International Criminal Court arrest warrant, Putin appeared unchallenged, while Trump’s approach raised concerns about the U.S. commitment to Ukraine’s territorial integrity. Ukrainian President Zelenskyy, excluded from the summit, is scheduled to meet Trump in Washington to discuss next steps, including security guarantees and the possibility of a trilateral summit. European leaders have emphasized the need for strong security guarantees for Ukraine and warned that Russia shows no intention of ending hostilities soon.</p>

<div class="h2-section-wrapper"><h2>Trump Reverses Position, Advocates for Peace Agreement Over Ceasefire in Ukraine War</h2><div class="source-indicator-container"><div class="source-item" data-href="https://www.wdio.com/front-page/top-stories/trump-reverses-need/RLBI276NWZG7THDFFYLOO5S7NY/"><img class="source-favicon" src="https://www.google.com/s2/favicons?domain=www.wdio.com" alt="Favicon for www.wdio.com"></div></div></div>
<p>In the aftermath of the Alaska summit, Donald Trump reversed his prior position advocating for a ceasefire, stating that a full peace agreement is the preferable path to ending the war in Ukraine. European officials involved in post-summit discussions reported that Putin reiterated demands for Ukraine to cede the Donbas regions, while showing openness to freezing the front lines in Zaporizhzhia and Kherson. Ukrainian President Zelenskyy has rejected territorial concessions, citing constitutional and security concerns.</p>
<p>Trump’s shift aligns with Kremlin demands and raises questions about how peace talks can proceed amid ongoing attacks, as Russian forces continue offensives and drone strikes across multiple fronts. German Chancellor Friedrich Merz noted that Russia appears willing to negotiate based on the current line of contact rather than administrative boundaries. European leaders welcomed U.S. efforts to end the war but stopped short of endorsing the abandonment of a ceasefire. Zelenskyy is set to meet Trump in Washington to discuss security guarantees and the potential for a trilateral summit, though Russian officials indicated no such meeting was discussed in Alaska.</p>

<p>The California Assembly released a proposed map of new congressional districts that would be subject to voter approval in a special election. The plan, submitted by the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, aims to counteract efforts by Texas to increase Republican representation in the U.S. House of Representatives. The proposed redistricting would reshape several districts, notably targeting Republican incumbents by altering district boundaries to include more Democratic voters.</p>
<p>The plan has drawn criticism from Republican representatives who argue that the maps are politically motivated gerrymanders that disregard community interests. The California Legislature is scheduled to consider measures to authorize the replacement of the existing map, approve the new map for voter approval, and call the special election. If approved, the new districts would take effect for the 2026, 2028, and 2030 elections. The initiative reflects escalating partisan tensions over redistricting in the United States ahead of the midterm elections.</p>

<div class="h2-section-wrapper"><h2>Schools Across New York Implement Cell Phone Bans With Varied Storage Policies</h2><div class="source-indicator-container"><div class="source-item" data-href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/schools-banning-students-using-cell-180755210.html"><img class="source-favicon" src="https://www.google.com/s2/favicons?domain=www.yahoo.com" alt="Favicon for www.yahoo.com"></div></div></div>
<p>In compliance with a new New York state law aimed at creating distraction-free learning environments, school districts across the state have adopted bans on student cell phone use during the school day. While the ban is consistent, policies vary widely regarding where students must store their phones, ranging from lockers and backpacks to designated bins or wearable pouches. Exceptions exist for emergencies, medical needs, and educational devices.</p>
<p>The law prohibits unsanctioned use of smartphones on school grounds and forbids storage in unsupervised lockers or backpacks in some cases. Schools must report on the implementation and effectiveness of their policies by September 2026. The varied approaches reflect challenges in balancing enforcement with practicality and student privacy, as districts seek to comply with the law while minimizing disruption.</p>
