<p>U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin commenced face-to-face talks at Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson in Anchorage, Alaska, in a summit aimed at shaping the future of the war in Ukraine and European security. The meeting, attended by top aides including U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, marks Putin's first visit to the U.S. since 2015.</p>
<p>Trump has expressed a strong desire to secure a ceasefire, stating he would be "not happy" if he left without some form of halt to hostilities. He also indicated openness to a follow-up meeting and suggested that any peace deal would likely involve territorial concessions by Ukraine, though he emphasized he is not negotiating on Ukraine’s behalf. The summit is seen as a pivotal moment, with Trump’s allies portraying him as a skilled negotiator capable of ending the conflict swiftly, while risks remain due to the deep divisions between Russia and Ukraine.</p>
<p>The event was marked by displays of military power, including flyovers by F-22 and B-2 bombers. Notably, Trump and Putin shared a ride in the American presidential limousine, an unusual gesture highlighting the summit’s personal diplomacy. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, excluded from the talks, called for a strong U.S. stance and a trilateral discussion involving Ukraine.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Trump administration is also engaged in a legal dispute over control of the Washington, D.C., police department, with the city suing to block federal efforts to install a Trump administration official as police chief.</p>

<div class="h2-section-wrapper"><h2>Federal Judge Blocks Trump Administration’s Anti-DEI Education Guidance</h2><div class="source-indicator-container"><div class="source-item" data-href="https://www.wbkb11.com/news/education/judge-strikes-down-trump-administration-guidance-against-dei-programs-at-schools-colleges/article_e26d1491-4944-53fa-8f2d-c14ef26986d0.html"><img class="source-favicon" src="https://www.google.com/s2/favicons?domain=www.wbkb11.com" alt="Favicon for www.wbkb11.com"></div></div></div>
<p>A federal judge in Maryland struck down two Trump administration directives aimed at eliminating diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs in U.S. schools and universities. U.S. District Judge Stephanie Gallagher ruled that the Department of Education violated procedural requirements when it threatened to withdraw federal funding from institutions continuing DEI initiatives.</p>
<p>The guidance, issued in February and April 2025, ordered educational institutions to cease all race-based decision-making or risk penalties, expanding the interpretation of a 2023 Supreme Court ruling on race in admissions. Judge Gallagher noted that the directives caused educators to fear punishment for lawful speech and association, and she rejected the government’s defense that the memos merely reminded schools that discrimination is illegal.</p>
<p>The ruling follows a lawsuit filed by the American Federation of Teachers and the American Sociological Association, supported by advocacy group Democracy Forward. The Education Department expressed disappointment but stated that enforcement of Title VI protections continues unabated.</p>

<div class="h2-section-wrapper"><h2>Overview of Palestinian Authority’s Role Amid Growing International Recognition</h2><div class="source-indicator-container"><div class="source-item" data-href="https://www.sbs.com.au/news/article/how-the-politics-of-gaza-works-and-how-australia-may-be-called-on-to-help/vsuavqsiv"><img class="source-favicon" src="https://www.google.com/s2/favicons?domain=www.sbs.com.au" alt="Favicon for www.sbs.com.au"></div></div></div>
<p>More than 30 years after the signing of the Oslo Accords, which established the Palestinian Authority (PA) as an interim government for the West Bank and Gaza Strip, the PA’s future role in governing Gaza post-conflict is under international focus. Australia recently announced plans to recognize a Palestinian state at the United Nations General Assembly, joining France, Canada, and the UK in this diplomatic movement.</p>
<p>The PA meets criteria for statehood under international law but faces challenges of legitimacy and effectiveness. Led by Mahmoud Abbas since 2005, the PA is perceived by many Palestinians as corrupt and lacking in popular support, partly due to Israeli policies such as settlement expansion and restrictions that undermine its authority. The PA currently has no control over Gaza, which has been governed by Hamas since 2007 following a violent split.</p>
<p>International actors including Egypt, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and Turkey maintain communication channels with Hamas. Reconstruction of Gaza will require extensive financial, technical, and political support from regional and global partners. Discussions are ongoing about security arrangements for a future Palestinian state, potentially involving Western and Arab League collaboration to ensure internal and external stability.</p>
<p>Experts note that despite longstanding obstacles, recent shifts in international consensus and regional politics may signal a turning point towards renewed efforts for peace and rebuilding.</p>

<div class="h2-section-wrapper"><h2>Tucker Carlson Faces Criticism for Hosting Orthodox Nun with Contested Claims on Israel</h2><div class="source-indicator-container"><div class="source-item" data-href="https://www.camera.org/article/tucker-carlson-allows-orthodox-nun-to-bear-false-witness-against-israel/"><img class="source-favicon" src="https://www.google.com/s2/favicons?domain=www.camera.org" alt="Favicon for www.camera.org"></div></div></div>
<p>Conservative commentator Tucker Carlson has drawn criticism for featuring Mother Agapia Stephanopoulos, an Orthodox nun, on his August 11, 2025, show to discuss Christian life in the Holy Land. The interview included numerous disputed and unsubstantiated claims about Israel and Palestinians.</p>
<p>Mother Stephanopoulos asserted that Palestinians are the sole descendants of the ancient Canaanites, misrepresented the timing of the first Christians, and inaccurately described biblical and historical facts about the region. She also alleged that Israel deliberately used water as a weapon against Palestinians, targeted religious sites, and was responsible for the American invasion of Iraq, among other claims.</p>
<p>The nun praised organizations and individuals known for anti-Israel or antisemitic positions, including Jewish Voice for Peace, and downplayed the role of Hamas in Palestinian suffering. She also propagated supersessionist biblical interpretations and made generalizations about Christian Zionists that experts have labeled misleading.</p>
<p>The interview has been analyzed by the Committee for Accuracy in Middle East Reporting and Analysis (CAMERA), which highlighted the factual inaccuracies and biased narratives presented. The organization called for future interviews on Middle East topics to feature guests providing factually accurate and balanced information.</p>
