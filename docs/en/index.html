<p>Germany announced on Friday that it will not authorize any exports of military equipment to Israel that could be used in Gaza "until further notice." Chancellor Friedrich Merz made the decision in response to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s Cabinet approval of plans to take over Gaza City. This move marks a significant shift by one of Israel’s strongest international backers and follows widespread international condemnation of the planned military occupation.</p>
<p>Merz emphasized that while Israel has the right to defend itself against Hamas, the intensified military action complicates the achievement of Israel’s stated goals. He called on Israel to allow comprehensive access for humanitarian aid deliveries and urged the Israeli government to address the humanitarian situation in Gaza sustainably. The German government’s decision adds to recent economic, military, and diplomatic measures taken by European countries concerned about Israel’s conduct in the nearly two-year conflict in Gaza.</p>
<p>Israel expressed disappointment with Germany’s decision, accusing it of rewarding Hamas and failing to support Israel’s "just war." Germany is the second-largest arms supplier to Israel after the United States, providing about 30% of Israel’s defense imports, primarily naval armaments. Experts suggest the German pause may be temporary but acknowledge its significance given Germany’s historically strong support for Israel rooted in Holocaust responsibility.</p>
<p>Other European officials, including the European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and foreign ministers from the Netherlands, Denmark, and the Czech Republic, have criticized Israel’s expansion of military operations in Gaza, expressing concern over civilian casualties and humanitarian conditions. Slovenia recently banned all weapons trade to and from Israel in response to its actions in Gaza.</p>
<p>The timing of Israel’s next major ground operation remains unclear but is expected to involve mobilizing thousands of troops and forcibly evacuating civilians, which could worsen the humanitarian crisis.</p>

<p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu convened his security cabinet on Thursday to discuss plans for the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) to occupy Gaza City, the largest city in the Gaza Strip. Netanyahu stated in a Fox News interview that Israel intends to take control of all Gaza but does not want to govern it, preferring to hand governance to Arab forces that would not threaten Israel.</p>
<p>The Israeli cabinet approved the plan despite international condemnation and growing humanitarian concerns in Gaza. The Israeli Prime Minister’s office said the IDF will prepare for the takeover while ensuring humanitarian aid reaches civilians outside combat zones.</p>
<p>Family members of hostages and protesters gathered outside the cabinet meeting, calling the occupation plan a "death sentence" for hostages held by Hamas. The Hostages and Missing Families Forum urged the government to prioritize a comprehensive deal for the hostages’ release.</p>
<p>Hamas criticized Netanyahu’s statements as a reversal of negotiation efforts and accused him of sacrificing hostages for ideological reasons. The U.S. State Department maintained focus on freeing hostages and preventing Hamas from ruling Gaza again but refrained from commenting directly on Israel’s military plans.</p>
<p>The potential expansion of military operations is seen as a response to Hamas’s reluctance to agree to a ceasefire deal that would include hostage releases.</p>

<p>Volker Turk, United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, issued a statement on Friday calling for an immediate halt to Israel’s planned military offensive to occupy Gaza City. Turk warned that the escalation would result in more killings, unbearable suffering, and senseless destruction.</p>
<p>He emphasized that Israel’s plan violates the International Court of Justice ruling requiring Israel to end its occupation of Gaza and respect Palestinians’ right to self-determination. Turk urged Israel to allow the unfettered flow of humanitarian aid and called for the immediate and unconditional release of hostages held by Palestinian armed groups, as well as the release of Palestinians detained by Israel.</p>
<p>The call came amid protests by families of hostages and others who fear the military operation will jeopardize the lives of those held captive. Turk stressed the need for a peaceful resolution allowing Israelis and Palestinians to live side by side in peace.</p>

<p>In Susquehanna County, Pennsylvania, a gunman shot and killed his neighbor before ambushing two responding state troopers with dozens of rounds, seriously injuring them. The incident occurred Thursday morning near Thompson Township.</p>
<p>The suspect, identified as 61-year-old Carmine Faino, fired from a tactically advantageous position and also shot down a drone deployed by law enforcement. An emergency medical technician (EMT) responding to the scene was injured in a vehicle crash while evading gunfire but survived.</p>
<p>Law enforcement established a perimeter and attempted negotiations, but the suspect remained a threat and was ultimately shot dead by a special emergency response team. The two injured troopers are hospitalized in stable condition, with one applying a tourniquet to his partner despite his own wounds. The EMT is also in stable condition.</p>
<p>Authorities described the shooting as planned rather than spontaneous. The motive remains under investigation.</p>

<div class="h2-section-wrapper"><h2>Texas Democrats Face GOP Deadline Amid Redistricting Standoff</h2><div class="source-indicator-container"><div class="source-item" data-href="https://www.k101fm.net/syndicated-article/?id=1631739"><img class="source-favicon" src="https://www.google.com/s2/favicons?domain=www.k101fm.net" alt="Favicon for www.k101fm.net"></div></div></div>
<p>Texas Democrats who fled the state to block Republican efforts to pass new congressional maps face a Friday deadline to return or face consequences, including potential arrest. The Texas House is scheduled to meet as Republicans seek to proceed with redistricting that would likely increase GOP seats in Congress.</p>
<p>Governor Greg Abbott has requested the Texas Supreme Court remove Democratic House Minority Leader Gene Wu from office due to the walkout. Wu and other Democrats have vowed to continue denying quorum unless Republicans agree to focus on other issues like flood mitigation.</p>
<p>House Speaker Dustin Burrows has suspended direct deposit of paychecks for absent members, requiring them to collect pay in person. Attorney General Ken Paxton has threatened court action to compel Democrats’ return and possible jail time if they refuse.</p>
<p>Democrats have fled to blue states such as Illinois and California, where California Governor Gavin Newsom and others have expressed support. California Democrats are preparing to counter Texas GOP’s proposed maps by targeting Republican-held districts in their state.</p>

<div class="h2-section-wrapper"><h2>Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Reports Strong Q2 2025 Results, Highlights Pipeline Progress</h2><div class="source-indicator-container"><div class="source-item" data-href="https://www.marketscreener.com/news/regeneron-pharmaceuticals-q2-2025-earnings-conference-call-transcript-ce7c5edddc8af323"><img class="source-favicon" src="https://www.google.com/s2/favicons?domain=www.marketscreener.com" alt="Favicon for www.marketscreener.com"></div></div></div>
<p>Regeneron Pharmaceuticals held its Q2 2025 earnings call on August 1, reporting solid financial performance and advances in its drug pipeline. Key commercial products showed strong growth: Dupixent global net sales rose 21% to $4.3 billion, Libtayo sales increased 25%, and EYLEA HD U.S. sales reached an all-time high of $393 million despite competitive pressures on the original EYLEA product.</p>
<p>The company anticipates delays in regulatory approvals for EYLEA HD enhancements due to an FDA inspection of the manufacturing site. Regeneron’s pipeline includes about 45 product candidates, with upcoming Phase 3 data expected for treatments in myeloma, lymphoma, allergies, and other conditions.</p>
<p>Notably, Lynozyfic, a BCMA bispecific antibody for multiple myeloma, was recently approved in the U.S. and is undergoing trials in earlier disease stages. The company is also advancing odronextamab for lymphoma and a Factor XI antibody for thrombosis prevention.</p>
<p>Regeneron plans to invest over $7 billion in U.S. research, development, and manufacturing capacity, while continuing shareholder returns through buybacks and dividends. The company remains open to business development opportunities that complement its internal R&amp;D focus.</p>
