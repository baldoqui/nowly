<p>Spirit Airlines' parent company, Spirit Aviation Holdings, has expressed "substantial doubt" about its future despite recently emerging from Chapter 11 bankruptcy. The low-cost carrier cited ongoing "adverse market conditions," including weak demand for domestic leisure travel and operational uncertainties expected to persist through at least the remainder of 2025.</p>
<p>Since filing for bankruptcy protection in November due to rising operational costs and heavy debt—totaling over $2.5 billion in losses since 2020—Spirit has restructured some of its debt and secured new financing. However, the airline continues to implement cost-cutting measures, such as planned furloughs of approximately 270 pilots and the downgrading of around 140 captains to first officers, scheduled for October and November. These moves align with the company's projected flight volume for 2026. Spirit’s stock has suffered sharply, dropping more than 40%, closing at $2.10 recently.</p>

<div class="h2-section-wrapper"><h2>Fleetwood Mac Duo Nicks and Buckingham Announce Album Reissue</h2><div class="source-indicator-container"><div class="source-item" data-href="https://nypost.com/2025/08/13/entertainment/a-timeline-of-fleetwood-macs-history-and-stevie-nicks-and-lindsey-buckinghams-relationship/"><img class="source-favicon" src="https://www.google.com/s2/favicons?domain=nypost.com" alt="Favicon for nypost.com"></div></div></div>
<p>Stevie Nicks and Lindsey Buckingham, the iconic duo behind Fleetwood Mac's classic era, have announced the reissue of their 1973 joint album, "Buckingham Nicks." This marks a rare moment of unity between the pair, whose tumultuous relationship defined much of the band's history.</p>
<p>Fleetwood Mac was formed in 1967 and underwent numerous lineup changes before achieving major success with Nicks and Buckingham joining in 1974. Their 1977 album "Rumours" became one of the best-selling albums worldwide, produced amid personal and professional turmoil. The original "Buckingham Nicks" album was a commercial failure but later drew attention from Mick Fleetwood, leading to their addition to the band. The reissue, set for release on September 19, will be available on CD and digital platforms for the first time, with the lead single "Crying in the Night" already released.</p>

<div class="h2-section-wrapper"><h2>Israel Plans Ground Operation to Take Full Control of Gaza Amid Western Criticism</h2><div class="source-indicator-container"><div class="source-item" data-href="https://www.middleeasteye.net/opinion/israels-plan-full-control-gaza-heralds-new-nakba-so-west-panicking"><img class="source-favicon" src="https://www.google.com/s2/favicons?domain=www.middleeasteye.net" alt="Favicon for www.middleeasteye.net"></div></div></div>
<p>The Israeli government has approved a plan to take "full control" of Gaza, starting with the takeover of Gaza City, where hundreds of thousands of Palestinians remain amid ongoing conflict. The operation aims to encircle, depopulate, and destroy the city, relocating survivors to a designated "humanitarian city" near the Egyptian border, raising fears of mass displacement and further humanitarian crisis.</p>
<p>Western nations, including the UK, Germany, Italy, and Australia, have jointly condemned the plan, warning it will exacerbate the already catastrophic humanitarian situation, endanger hostages, and risk mass civilian displacement. Germany has announced a suspension of arms shipments to Israel in response, though the United States is expected to maintain its support. Critics highlight that Israel has maintained control over Gaza for decades, with the current plan representing a further step in what some describe as a settler-colonial agenda and ethnic cleansing.</p>
<p>The move also signals a diminishing prospect for the long-discussed two-state solution, with Western leaders facing increasing pressure to recognize Palestinian statehood even as Israel advances annexation and settlement expansion in the West Bank.</p>

<div class="h2-section-wrapper"><h2>U.S. Housing Market Faces Softening Prices and Generational Challenges</h2><div class="source-indicator-container"><div class="source-item" data-href="https://www.theatlantic.com/podcasts/archive/2025/08/david-frum-show-housing-glenn-kelman-redfin/683851/"><img class="source-favicon" src="https://www.google.com/s2/favicons?domain=www.theatlantic.com" alt="Favicon for www.theatlantic.com"></div></div></div>
<p>The U.S. housing market is showing signs of softening for the first time in nearly a decade, with home prices expected to decline modestly in the latter half of 2025. Redfin CEO Glenn Kelman highlighted ongoing challenges including low inventory, weak sales volume, and the impact of pandemic-era low mortgage rates that have locked many homeowners into favorable financing, reducing market turnover.</p>
<p>The average age of first-time homebuyers has risen from 31 to 38 over the past decade, reflecting affordability issues. Sellers, especially those who purchased homes during the pandemic with low-interest loans, face difficulties selling at prices that would cover their mortgages, while buyers contend with higher borrowing costs. Regional disparities persist, with Florida facing volatility due to climate-related insurance cost increases, while the Midwest shows relative stability.</p>
<p>Kelman advocates for zoning reform to allow higher density housing, reduction of rent controls, and streamlined approval processes to stimulate building. He emphasizes the need for a building boom and bipartisan political will to address the housing shortage, which he estimates at 4 to 5 million units nationally. Despite the bleak outlook, Kelman remains cautiously optimistic that market corrections and increased construction could improve affordability over time.</p>

<div class="h2-section-wrapper"><h2>Bishop E.W. Jackson Calls for Prayer and Action to Restore American Values and Address Crime</h2><div class="source-indicator-container"><div class="source-item" data-href="https://afr.net/podcasts/the-awakening/2025/august/join-the-fight-for-americas-values/"><img class="source-favicon" src="https://www.google.com/s2/favicons?domain=afr.net" alt="Favicon for afr.net"></div></div></div>
<p>Bishop E.W. Jackson, host of "The Awakening" podcast on American Family Radio, delivered a passionate appeal for prayer, volunteerism, and financial support to preserve what he describes as America's Judeo-Christian heritage and constitutional republic. He emphasized the need to combat what he terms Marxist and socialist threats to national greatness and called for unity around principles of faith, family, and free market economics.</p>
<p>Jackson praised former President Donald Trump’s initiatives to reduce crime in Washington D.C., highlighting recent federal efforts including National Guard deployment and arrests of violent offenders. He detailed the high crime rates in the U.S. capital, citing incidents of carjackings, shootings, and violence affecting law enforcement personnel and civilians, including children. He criticized judicial leniency and called for swift and firm punishment of criminals, including juveniles involved in serious offenses.</p>
<p>The bishop urged listeners to support his organization, Stand, and the American Family Association through prayer, volunteering, and donations to advance their mission of restoring family values and public safety.</p>

<div class="h2-section-wrapper"><h2>Michigan Football Adds Experienced Quarterback Mikey Keene as Backup</h2><div class="source-indicator-container"><div class="source-item" data-href="https://mgoblog.com/content/2025-recruiting-mikey-keene"><img class="source-favicon" src="https://www.google.com/s2/favicons?domain=mgoblog.com" alt="Favicon for mgoblog.com"></div></div></div>
<p>The University of Michigan football team has added quarterback Mikey Keene, a transfer from Fresno State, to its roster as an experienced backup and mentor. Keene brings extensive playing experience, having started multiple seasons at UCF and Fresno State, accumulating nearly 6,000 passing yards and 42 touchdowns in his collegiate career.</p>
<p>Keene is noted for his high football IQ, leadership, and ability to operate efficiently in a passing offense, especially under pressure. While his arm strength is considered moderate and his mobility limited, his familiarity with Michigan’s offensive coordinator Chip Lindsey’s system is viewed as a key asset. Keene suffered a minor shoulder injury in spring but is expected to compete for playing time behind starter Bryce Underwood.</p>
<p>The coaching staff values Keene’s maturity and experience to provide stability and guidance for the quarterback unit, with potential future roles in coaching anticipated.</p>
