<div class="h2-section-wrapper"><h2>India Advances Strategic Engagement in the Mediterranean Region Amid Geopolitical Flux</h2><div class="source-indicator-container"><div class="source-item" data-href="https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/why-india-needs-a-grand-strategy-for-mediterranean-region-amid-trumpian-turbulence-ws-e-13923129.html"><img class="source-favicon" src="https://www.google.com/s2/favicons?domain=www.firstpost.com" alt="Favicon for www.firstpost.com"></div></div></div>
<p>India is intensifying its diplomatic and strategic presence in the Mediterranean region, recognizing the area's critical role in global geopolitics and economic connectivity. Recent visits by Prime Minister Narendra Modi to Cyprus and Croatia, alongside ongoing cooperation with countries such as Greece, Israel, Egypt, France, and Italy, underscore India's pursuit of a comprehensive Mediterranean policy. The region's strategic location as a nexus between Asia, Europe, and North Africa, coupled with its rich natural resources and critical maritime routes like the Suez Canal, makes it vital for India's energy security and trade interests.</p>
<p>India's approach balances geopolitical challenges, including Turkey's assertive regional posture and the complex dynamics involving Russia, the United States, and China. The India-Middle East-Europe Corridor (IMEC) initiative, launched in 2023, exemplifies India's effort to enhance connectivity and economic integration in the region. Strategic partnerships with Mediterranean countries enable India to counterbalance regional threats, particularly those posed by Turkey's alliances with Pakistan and Azerbaijan. Enhanced naval presence, trilateral cooperation frameworks with Greece and Cyprus, and robust economic ties reflect India's pragmatic and multifaceted policy to secure its interests in the Mediterranean's evolving geopolitical landscape.</p>
