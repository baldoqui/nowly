<p>Al Jazeera confirmed the death of its correspondent Anas al-Sharif in an Israeli strike on Gaza City. The Israeli military alleged that al-Sharif was the leader of a Hamas militant cell and responsible for attacks on Israeli civilians and troops, claims denied by Al Jazeera and condemned by press freedom groups. The strike also killed three other journalists and a driver near Shifa Hospital. This incident occurred as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced a wider military offensive targeting Hamas strongholds in Gaza City and surrounding camps, sheltering over half a million displaced people. Netanyahu emphasized that the goal is to "free Gaza" by dismantling Hamas infrastructure, asserting there is no policy of starvation despite humanitarian concerns.</p>
<p>The United States defended Israel's actions at the United Nations Security Council, rejecting allegations of genocide and supporting Israel's right to security. However, other council members, including China and Russia, expressed alarm over the humanitarian situation, with the UN describing conditions in Gaza as "beyond horrific." At least 31 Palestinians were reported killed while seeking aid, and the hunger-related death toll among children in Gaza has reached 100 since the war began.</p>

<p>Ukrainian forces launched drone attacks on key oil refineries deep inside Russia, including the Lukoil-Ukhta refinery in the Komi Republic, located approximately 2,000 kilometers from the Ukrainian border. The strikes targeted facilities supplying fuel to Russian forces, causing fires and operational disruptions. Additional drone attacks were reported on a refinery in Saratov Oblast and a storage site for Shahed-type drones in Tatarstan Republic. Ukrainian military intelligence confirmed these operations as part of efforts to degrade Russia's war capabilities.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Ukrainian forces liberated the village of Bezsalivka near the Russian border in Sumy Oblast, marking progress on the northeastern front. Despite ongoing Russian advances, Ukraine maintains firm resistance. Diplomatic efforts continue ahead of a planned summit between U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska, with Ukraine and European officials rejecting Putin's ceasefire proposal that demands territorial concessions. Ukraine insists on sovereignty, NATO membership prospects, and the return of displaced persons as prerequisites for peace.</p>

<div class="h2-section-wrapper"><h2>Israeli settlers intensify West Bank campaign amid rising tensions</h2><div class="source-indicator-container"><div class="source-item" data-href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/bowen-israeli-settlers-intensify-campaign-210333535.html"><img class="source-favicon" src="https://www.google.com/s2/favicons?domain=www.yahoo.com" alt="Favicon for www.yahoo.com"></div></div></div>
<p>Jewish settlers in the West Bank, particularly in the area south of Hebron, have intensified efforts to consolidate control over land amid rising tensions following the October 7, 2023 Hamas attacks and Israel’s military response. Settler leaders claim that many Palestinian farmers have left the area, interpreting the developments as a sign that Palestinians have no future there. Violence by ultra-nationalist settlers against Palestinians has increased, with the UN reporting an average of four settler attacks daily. The International Court of Justice has declared the Israeli occupation of Palestinian territories illegal, a position rejected by Israel.</p>
<p>Settler leaders openly express religious and ideological motivations, viewing the land as divinely destined for Jews. Israeli government ministers supporting settlement expansion have provided resources and political backing. Critics warn that the line between settlers and the Israeli military is increasingly blurred, with settlers forming regional defense units. The situation raises concerns about potential ethnic displacement and undermines prospects for a two-state solution.</p>

<div class="h2-section-wrapper"><h2>Mass immigration raids in Los Angeles cause economic and social disruption</h2><div class="source-indicator-container"><div class="source-item" data-href="https://www.sgvtribune.com/2025/06/18/in-la-county-and-its-working-class-suburbs-a-plague-of-fear-and-silence-in-once-busy-immigrant-hubs/"><img class="source-favicon" src="https://www.google.com/s2/favicons?domain=www.sgvtribune.com" alt="Favicon for www.sgvtribune.com"></div><div class="source-item" data-href="https://www.dailybreeze.com/2025/06/18/in-la-county-and-its-working-class-suburbs-a-plague-of-fear-and-silence-in-once-busy-immigrant-hubs/"><img class="source-favicon" src="https://www.google.com/s2/favicons?domain=www.dailybreeze.com" alt="Favicon for www.dailybreeze.com"></div></div></div>
<p>Federal immigration enforcement raids in Los Angeles and surrounding areas have led to widespread fear and economic downturn in immigrant communities. Businesses, especially restaurants and markets frequented by undocumented workers and residents, report significant drops in customers and revenue. Many immigrants avoid public spaces, including sensitive locations such as churches and hospitals, due to fears of detention and deportation.</p>
<p>Local authorities and community organizations have responded by studying the economic impact and organizing support initiatives, including food and legal aid delivery. Despite some pauses in enforcement at farms and hospitality venues following industry concerns, the administration has vowed to continue mass deportations, targeting major cities with large undocumented populations. The raids have sparked protests and heightened tensions, with immigrant communities expressing fear and uncertainty about their future.</p>

<div class="h2-section-wrapper"><h2>Canadian arms exports to Israel under scrutiny amid Gaza conflict</h2><div class="source-indicator-container"><div class="source-item" data-href="https://www.theglobeandmail.com/politics/article-canadian-rules-military-exports-to-israel-explained/"><img class="source-favicon" src="https://www.google.com/s2/favicons?domain=www.theglobeandmail.com" alt="Favicon for www.theglobeandmail.com"></div></div></div>
<p>Canadian military exports to Israel have come under increased scrutiny following reports of shipments of components and equipment potentially used in the Gaza conflict. While the Canadian government maintains it has suspended permits for lethal weapons to Israel since January 2024 and restricts exports to non-lethal items such as those used in the Iron Dome defense system, activists and some senators question the transparency and adequacy of these measures.</p>
<p>Customs data released by pro-Palestinian activists suggested shipments categorized as munitions and armored vehicles, which Canadian officials have disputed, describing some as non-lethal or for training purposes. Calls for a full investigation and suspension of all military trade with Israel have grown amid concerns over complicity in human rights violations. Public opinion in Canada shows a majority favoring restrictions on arms exports to Israel.</p>

<div class="h2-section-wrapper"><h2>Bernie Sanders interview highlights progressive agenda and Gaza war criticism</h2><div class="source-indicator-container"><div class="source-item" data-href="https://newsbusters.org/blogs/nb/jorge-bonilla/2025/08/10/socialists-soft-focus-cnns-dana-bash-squees-over-bernie-sanders"><img class="source-favicon" src="https://www.google.com/s2/favicons?domain=newsbusters.org" alt="Favicon for newsbusters.org"></div></div></div>
<p>In a CNN interview, Senator Bernie Sanders discussed his ongoing efforts to advocate for working-class Americans, criticizing the Democratic Party for neglecting economic inequality and healthcare reform. Sanders emphasized the need for a government that guarantees healthcare as a human right, raises the minimum wage, and combats the influence of billionaires in politics.</p>
<p>On foreign policy, Sanders condemned the Israeli offensive in Gaza, attributing the humanitarian crisis to the Netanyahu government rather than Hamas, which he labeled a terrorist organization but did not hold responsible for the starvation of Palestinians. He called Netanyahu a war criminal and criticized U.S. funding of Israel. Sanders affirmed his belief in Israel as a Jewish state but expressed concern over its international standing due to current policies. The interview also touched on upcoming U.S. elections and the potential for future progressive leadership.</p>
